## Introduction

Growing numbers of people are working in startups and fast-growing tech companies.
If you’re one of them, or are considering becoming one, you’ve probably experienced or
tried to learn about stock and stock options, RSUs, and other types of
[**equity compensation**](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity-compensation.asp).

🚧 Groundwork:
Significance (#s of ppl dealing with these questions, examples of real-world results
(happy and horror) of taking equity comp, eg., why should we learn more, why should we
care?)

🚧 Groundwork:
Some history of the rise of equity compensation in the US and how it links to focus on
shareholder value.
Any links about positive/negative/controversial aspects of this broad economic trend?

Many people learn the basic ideas of stock, stock options, or RSUs from personal
experience or from colleagues or helpful friends who have been through it before.
In fact, equity compensation is complex enough it’s usually only fully understood by tax
attorneys and investment professionals.

Most candidates and employees far less information than the person at their company in
charge of hiring or managing, which can at times be unfair.
At the same time, founders and hiring managers may not know everything, and often struggle
with talking through the web of technicalities with potential hires.
Both companies and employees are routinely hurt by uninformed decisions and costly
mistakes when it comes to equity compensation.
Talk to anyone who’s worked in startups and you’ll hear stories of how they or their
colleagues met with the painful consequences of not learning enough up front.

### Why this Guide?

Because you shouldn’t need a law degree or MBA to protect yourself when dealing with the
details of equity compensation.
Because you shouldn’t have to know someone kind and brilliant in financial ops or HR.
Because you shouldn’t have to fail before you succeed.

While [a lot of information](#further-reading) on this topic is just a Google search away,
the best information is scattered about.
Many blogs and articles focus only on a narrow topic, are getting older, or are on sites
supported by ads or other products.

We’ll take you through the common scenarios, pitfalls, and best practices of negotiating
equity compensation.
An hour or two reading the material here and checking out the linked resources could
ultimately be among the most financially valuable ways you spend your time.

🚧 Groundwork:
About how and why this was written.

### Should you read this?

Our aim is to be as helpful to the absolute beginner as it is for those with more
experience. No matter how much you know (or think you know!)
about equity compensation, you likely run into confusion at some point.

If you’re an **employee** or **candidate for a job**, some of these may apply to you:

- You’ve heard phrases like *stock*, *stock options*, *strike price*, *ISOs*, *RSUs*, *83(b)*,
  *409A*, *AMT*, or *early exercise* and know they are probably important but are mystified
  by what some of them really mean—or what they mean for your situation.
- You’re getting a new job offer but don’t know how to navigate or negotiate the equity
  component of the offer.
- You’re joining a startup for the first time, and are overwhelmed by all the paperwork!
- You’re quitting or are being laid off or fired from a company where you have stock or
  options and are thinking through the decisions and consequences.
- A company you work for is going through an acquisition, IPO, or shutdown.
- You have stock in a private company and need cash.

🔹 This Guide is also useful for **founders** or **hiring managers** who need to talk about
equity compensation with employees or potential hires.
As many entrepreneurs or hiring managers will tell you, this topic is not easy on that
side of the table, either!
Negotiating with and fielding questions from candidates and employees requires
understanding it well.

### What is covered?

We believe it is critical for everyone to understand basic concepts and some very
technical details about the exact type of compensation you have or might have.

- This includes the tax consequences.
  Equity compensation and taxation might seem like different topics, but they are so
  intertwined it’s hard to explain one without the other.
- An understanding of the underlying rules is also necessary for negotiating fair offers—on
  both sides.
- This Guide applies to [**C corporations**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_corporation) in the
  **United States**.
- It’s geared towards employees, advisors, and independent contractors who want to know how
  stock and stock options in C corps work.
  This includes most startups.
  Typically startups and major companies are C corps, and not
  [LLCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_liability_company) or
  [S corporations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_corporation). LLC equity compensation is
  different and not covered in this Guide (yet).

🚧 Why are LLCs rarely used?

🚧 Structure: More of a roadmap of covered topics.

This Guide is intended to complement (not replace) professional advice.
Even experienced attorneys and tax experts can be confusing, and it will be easier to work
with them when you have deeper understanding yourself.

## Companies, Compensation, and Stock

### What is a company?

- 🄳 A **company** is a legal entity formed under corporate law for the purpose of conducting
  trade. In the United States,
  [several kinds of business entities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_business_entity#United_States)
  may be formed, or [**incorporated**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_(business)),
  under the laws of a specific state.
- 🄳 A [**startup**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company) is an emerging company that
  aspires to grow quickly.
  Once a company is established in the market and successful for a while, it usually stops
  being called a startup.
  - ☝️ The term *startup* is pretty informal.
    It’s not a legal concept, and not everyone uses it consistently.
    For our purposes, it’s best just to think of it as the young period of a fast-growing
    company.
  - 🚧 Groundwork:
    Stats on how many people work in startups vs established companies.
- Companies involve many people, so it’s important to track how much of the company each
  person owns, so that future profits are divided appropriately.
  Historically, this has been done a few ways, depending on the size and nature of the
  company. One way to do this, especially when a lot of people are involved, is via stock,
  which we’ll get into next.
- Companies in the US include sole proprietorships, partnerships, limited liability
  companies (LLCs), S corporations, and C corporations.
  - 🔸 This Guide does not cover equity compensation in LLCs, as they are rarely used as the
    choice of entity for technology startups, and equity compensation in LLCs is dramatically
    different from equity compensation in corporations.
    So we’ll focus on the one type of company most readers of this Guide will be concerned
    with: The C corporation.
- 🄳 A [**C corporation (or C corp)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_corporation) is a type of
  business entity in the United States.
  Specifically, it’s a kind of
  [stock corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint-stock_company) with certain federal
  tax treatment.
  Most large companies you’ve heard of, as well as startups that aspire to be large, are C
  corporations. In practice, for a
  [few](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/business/how-delaware-thrives-as-a-corporate-tax-haven.html)
  [reasons](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-most-technology-startups-incorporate-in-Delaware),
  these companies are usually formed in Delaware, so legalities of all this are defined in
  Delaware law.

### What is compensation?

🄳 **Compensation** is everything you get when working for a company.
Some compensation is cash—your salary and bonus, if you get one.
Other parts are benefits, like health insurance, family-related protections, perks, and
retirement plans.
But for many jobs, compensation includes a kind of ownership in a company, called equity.
It’s this last part we focus on.

To understand exactly how compensation works, it helps to start at the beginning:
What is a company, exactly?
What is ownership, exactly?
And what is this ownership worth?

### What is stock and what is equity?

- 🄳 [**Stock**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock) is a legal invention that helps track
  ownership of a company.
  It allows the company to grant ownership to a variety of people or other companies in
  flexible ways.
  Stock is divided into **shares**, and every owner, or **shareholder**, holds a specific number
  of shares. Founders, investors, employees, board members, contractors, advisors, and other
  companies, like law firms, can all be shareholders.
- 🄳 Stock ownership is formalized on **stock certificates**, which are fancy pieces of paper
  that prove you own the stock.
  - Sometimes you have stock but don’t have the physical certificate, as it may be held for
    you at a law office.
  - 🄳 Some companies now manage their ownership through online services called **ownership
    management platforms**, such as [Carta](https://carta.com/). If the company you work for uses
    an ownership management platform, you will be able to view your stock certificates and
    stock values online.
  - 🚧 Mention that stock may be taxable up front (and reference section).
- 🄳 The [**outstanding shares**](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outstandingshares.asp) are
  the total number of shares at a given point, reflecting how many shares are currently held
  by all shareholders.
  This number starts at an essentially arbitrary value (such as 10 million) when the company
  is created, and thereafter will increase as new shares are added (issued) and granted to
  people in exchange for money or services.
  Outstanding shares may increase or decrease for other reasons too (such as stock splits
  and share buybacks, which we won’t get into here).
  There is a lot of nuance and complexity in all this, because each part is defined by piles
  and piles of legal documents.
  - 🚧 More on stock splits and share buyback.
- If you have stock, what ultimately matters is not the number of shares you hold, but the
  **percentage ownership** of the entire company that that number represents.
  To determine the percentage of the company a certain number of shares represents, you
  divide it by the number of outstanding shares.
  Even if you have a fixed number of shares, your percentage ownership will change over time
  as the outstanding shares change.
- 🄳 Informally, we say you have **equity** in a company when you have some kind of ownership
  or likely future ownership.
  In practice, this can mean, stock, stock options, and RSUs, which we’ll divide and conquer
  later.
  - ☝️ The word “equity” has
    [several technical meanings](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp) in accounting
    and other financial contexts, but when we talk about equity compensation, it is meant more
    informally.
- **Why give equity compensation?**
  The purpose of equity compensation is twofold.
  - To attract the best talent:
    When a company already has or can be predicted to have significant financial success, the
    most talented people are incentivized to work for the company by the prospect of their
    equity turning into large amounts of cash in the future.
  - To align individuals’ incentives with the interests of the company:
    Even companies that can afford to pay lots of cash may prefer to give employees equity, so
    that employees work to increase the *future* value of the company.
    At its best, this philosophy fosters an environment of teamwork and a “rising tides lift
    all boats” mentality.
    As we’ll talk more about during our chapter on [negotiations](#negotiations-and-offers), the
    amount of equity you’re offered usually reflects both your past or current contribution to
    the company and your commitment to the company in the future.

### What is equity worth?

🚧 Structure: This section needs to establish a relationship between each of these
definitions and the concept of what equity is worth.
How does each of these circumstances affect the “worth” of shares?
May also consider whether this section should be “What is the value of equity?”, to
parallel the section that follows.

- 🄳 [**Public companies**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company) are corporations where
  any member of the public can own stock.
  People can buy and sell the stock for cash on public
  [exchanges](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange.asp). The value of a company’s
  shares is the value you see in the stock market reports, so shareholders know how much
  their stock is worth.
- 🄳 Most smaller companies, including all startups, are
  [**private companies**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privately_held_company) with owners who
  control how those companies operate.
  Unlike a public company, where anyone is able to buy and sell stock, owners of a private
  company control who is able to buy and sell their stock.
  There may be few or no transactions, or they may not be publicly known.
- ❗️ It’s hard to know the “real value” of private company stock.
  Because the value of private company stock is not determined by public trades,
  shareholders can only make educated guesses about the likely future value, at a time when
  they will be able to buy or sell the stock.
  It’s always worth remembering *stock is a legal agreement* that entitles you to something
  of highly uncertain value, and could well be worthless in the future, or highly valuable,
  depending on the fate of the company.
  - ☝️ We’ll discuss the notion of [fair market value](#409a-valuations) later, but even if a
    company assigns a value to the stock for tax and accounting purposes, it doesn’t mean you
    can expect to sell it for that value!
- Public and some private companies can pay
  [**dividends**](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp) (allocations of a company’s
  profit determined by the company’s board) to shareholders, but this is not common among
  startups and other companies focused on growth.
  - 🚧 Explain more why this is.
    Define dividends better.
- 🄳 The ability to buy and sell stock is called **liquidity**. In startups and many private
  companies, it is typical to hold the stock until the company is sold or becomes public in
  an [**IPO**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering). A sale or IPO is often
  called an **exit** or **liquidity event**. Sales, dissolutions, and bankruptcy are all called
  **liquidations**.
  - 🚧 “Becomes public” isn’t a clear enough definition of IPO. More detailed explanation of
    “going public” top of this section at “public companies” defining occurrence, above.
- **Private sales**: Liquidity events *may never happen*-if, say, the company stays private or
  shuts down. But lacking the eventuality of a liquidity event, individuals may still buy or
  sell stock (“gain liquidity”) in private companies in specific ways:
  - 🄳 In a few cases, you may be able to sell private company stock to another private party,
    such as an accredited investor who wants to invest in the company.
    Sales between private parties like this are also called **secondary market** transactions,
    to [distinguish them](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondarymarket.asp) from **primary
    market** transactions where companies directly sell to investors.
  - 🔸 While many who hold stock hope or expect they need only find a willing buyer, in
    practice, secondary sales only work out in a few situations.
    In some cases, you may have luck selling stock privately to an individual, like a board
    member or former executive who wishes to increase their ownership.
    You can find further discussion of this topic
    [on Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-do-employees-in-startups-sell-stock-in-the-secondary-markets).
  - 🔸 Sales generally require the agreement and cooperation of the company, for both
    contractual and practical reasons.
  - 🄳 Typically, shares held by an employee are subject to a **right of first refusal** in
    favor of the company, meaning the employee can’t sell their shares to a third party
    without offering to sell their shares to the company first.
  - **Why companies may not support secondary sales**: It’s important to consider a company’s
    perspective on secondary sales as well.
    - Historically, startups have seen little purpose in letting current employees sell their
      stock, since they prefer employees hold their stock and work to make it more valuable by
      improving the value of the company as a whole.
    - But former employees and other shareholders often have difficulty initiating secondary
      transactions as well.
      Private buyers may ask for the company’s internal financials in order to estimate the
      current and future value of its stock;
      the company may not wish to share this confidential information.
      Companies
      [also must consider](https://www.square1bank.com/insights/new-normal-secondaries-409a-valuation-process/)
      whether sales could influence their [409A valuation](#409a-valuations).
    - Secondary sales are also an administrative and legal burden that may not make it to the
      top of the list of priorities for busy startup CEOs and CFOs.
    - In late-stage funding rounds, companies frequently do secondary offerings where employees
      may be eligible to sell a portion of their stock.
  - 🔹 **Secondary buyers**: Thinking on all this
    [has evolved](http://www.industryventures.com/2014/12/02/employee-liquidity-good-for-private-companies/)
    [in recent years](https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/14/selling-private-company-shares-2-0/).
    Some companies do see value in offering (mostly limited) opportunities for sale.
    [SharesPost](http://sharespost.com/), [Equidate](https://www.equidateinc.com/), and
    [EquityZen](https://equityzen.com/) have sought to establish a market around secondary sales,
    particularly for well-known pre-IPO companies.
    A few other secondary firms have emerged that have interest in certain purchases,
    especially for larger sales from founders, early employees, or executives (parties
    generally in possession of larger shares).
    A company can work with the firm to facilitate multiple transactions.
    These firms include [137 Ventures](http://137ventures.com/),
    [ESO Fund](https://employeestockoptions.com/),
    [Akkadian Ventures](https://www.akkadianventures.com/),
    [Industry Ventures](http://www.industryventures.com/), [Atlas Peak](http://www.atlaspeakcap.com/),
    and [Founders Circle](http://www.founderscircle.com/). The goal of these firms is to make
    money of these purchases, so it will work if they believe the stock has chance of
    significant future value.
    In other words, if your company isn’t doing well, don’t be surprised if you can’t sell at
    all on the secondary market.

### How does the value of equity change?

We’ve now seen how hard it is to estimate the value of equity in private companies,
because often stock can’t be sold.

🚧 Structure: So this is actually not currently in the preceding section.
Why and how does whether stock can be sold affect its value at all?

Understanding equity is more complex than knowing its “true value” at a single point in
time. The intention of giving shareholders equity is to grow the company—it’s about the
future. So the value of your equity is a reflection of three major concerns:

1. How well the company is doing now—that is, how profitable it is.
2. How well the company will perform in the future.
3. How likely it is the company will be valuable as part of another company—that is, whether
   it may be [acquired](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/acquisition.asp).

🚧 Add definition of acquisition of public company (will also include IPO)

Only the first concern is relatively clear.
The second and third are all a matter of prediction and never certain.
Broadly, it’s important to understand how uncertain each of these concerns are depending
on the stage of the company.

In public companies, markets set the value of stock based on perceptions of all this, and
it’s easy to sell your stock, too, so you know its value today.

🚧 Structure: How exactly does one sell stock?
Perhaps to add in What is Equity Worth, b/c the value of shares is affected by who sells
and when? E.g.
what professionals/entities do we need to know about in case this is something we want to
do? This is one of the Mysteries to many general readers.
(Have considered whether a section devoted to the structure and processes of the stock
market would fall within our scope.)

In later stage private companies, the financials of the company are still known, at least
to some people within the company, and these predictions are usually more certain.

In earlier stage private companies, there may be little or no profit, but the company may
seem valuable because of high expectations that it can make future profit or be acquired.
If a company like this takes money from investors, the investors determine the price they
pay based on these educated guesses.
In short, when considering early stage private companies like startups, there is more
guesswork and more uncertainty about the future value of equity.

### Fundraising, growth, and dilution

🄳 In order to finance a new company, startups **fundraise** by selling shares in their
business to [investors](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp) in exchange for
capital. For startups that aspire to grow rapidly, it’s likely they will fundraise from
investors called **venture capitalists**.

A startup goes through [several stages of growth](#stages-of-a-startup) as it fundraises
based on evidence that it will make money in the future.

At the other end of the spectrum from early stage startups are large, established
companies.

- 🄳 As these companies add (or “issue”) stock, the outstanding shares goes up, and the
  percentage ownership of each shareholder goes down.
  This is called [**dilution**](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dilution.asp). That’s a
  confusing word to most humans, but the concept is relatively simple so don’t let it freak
  you out:
  - Dilution doesn’t necessarily mean that as a shareholder you’re losing anything-usually, as
    a company raises money and issues stock, the hope and intention is that what you do have
    is worth more.
    The size of your slice gets relatively smaller, but if the company is growing, the size of
    the cake gets bigger.
  - For example, a typical startup might have three rounds of funding, with each round of
    funding issuing 20% more shares.
    At the end of the three rounds, there are more outstanding shares-roughly 70% more in this
    case, since 120%×120%×120% is 173%-and each shareholder owns proportionally less of the
    company.
- 🄳 The [**valuation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)) of the company is the
  present value investors believe the company has.
  If the company is doing well, making more revenue or gaining users (indicating future
  revenue), the company’s valuation will usually be going up.
  That is, the **price** to an investor for buying one share would be increasing.
- ❗️ Of course, things do not always go well, and the valuation of a company does not always
  go up. If the valuation by investors of a company goes down, then the value of everyone’s
  shares goes down.
  When investors expect a company to do better than it actually does, it can have a lot of
  disappointing consequences for shareholders.
  The implications of this are complicated, and we’ll get into them further.
  But it can happen that a company fails and everyone’s shares become worthless, or that
  certain kinds of shares become worthless while other kinds have some value.

🚧 More on how larger companies think about stock, growth, and equity compensation.

🚧 Much more on dilution and growing equity value.
Infographic.

🚧 Structure: Perhaps THIS is the material that belongs in “What is equity worth?”. Either
that section can become a general overview of what to expect re:
how value is determined and how it changes, and/or move the details on selling stock in
“What is equity worth?”
to a section on how to sell—and THERE we can learn how to do that!

### Counting shares

There are important subtleties in how outstanding shares are counted:

- 🄳 Private companies always have what are referred to as **authorized but unissued** shares,
  referring to shares that are legally authorized but have not yet been issued.
  Until they are issued, the shares don’t mean anything to the company;
  no one owns them.
  - 🚧 Who “authorizes” shares?
    What does that mean?
    That there are a certain number of shares that can technically be issued… What determines
    this number? Who determines it?
  - ☝️ When you are trying to determine what percentage a number of shares represents, you do
    *not* make reference to the authorized but unissued shares.
  - For example, a corporation might have 100 million *authorized* shares, but will only have
    *issued* 10 million shares.
    In this example, the corporation would have 90 million *authorized but unissued* shares.
- ☝️ You actually want to know the total issued, but even this number can be confusing, as
  it can be computed
  [more than one way](http://www.mattbartus.com/option-grants-fully-diluted-or-issued-and-outstanding/).
  Typically, people count shares in two ways:
  “issued and outstanding” and “fully diluted.”
- 🄳 **Issued and outstanding** refers to the number of shares actually issued by the company
  to shareholders, and does not include shares that others may have an option to purchase.
- 🄳 **Fully diluted** refers to all of the shares that have been issued, all of the shares
  that have been set aside in a stock incentive plan, and all of the shares that could be
  issued if all convertible securities (such as outstanding warrants) were exercised.
  A key difference is that this total will include all the shares in the employee option
  pool that are reserved but not yet issued to employees.
  (The option pool is discussed more below.)
- 🔹 If you’re trying to figure out the likely percentage a number of shares will be worth
  in the future, it’s best to know the number of shares that are fully diluted.
- ☝️ The terminology mentioned here isn’t universally applied.
  It’s worth discussing these terms with your company to be sure you’re on the same page.

### Classes of stock

Stock comes with various legal rights.
Often investors ask for rights to be paid back first in exchange for their investment.
The way these different rights are handled is by creating different
[classes of shares](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/class.asp).

🄳 Two important kinds of stock to be aware of are
[**common stock**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_stock) and
[**preferred stock**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferred_stock). This can all vary from
company to company, but it’s safe to understand *preferred* stock as stock that has
additional “rights, preferences, and privileges” that *common* stock does not have.
(Yes, indeed, the lawyers
[really talk that way](https://www.americanbar.org/publications/blt/2014/01/04_bigler.html).)
The specific differences can also vary at [each round of funding](#stages-of-a-startup).

Some detail on how this works:

- Investors generally get preferred stock, and founders and employees get common stock (or
  an *option* to buy common stock, which we’ll get to in a minute).
  - ☝️ You’ll also hear the term
    [**founders’ stock**](http://www.alleywatch.com/2013/08/what-is-founders-stock-legally/), which is
    ([usually](http://lsvp.com/2008/09/15/what-entrepreneurs-need-to-know-about-founders-stock/))
    common stock allocated at a company’s formation.
- 🄳 Preferred stock usually has a
  [**liquidation preference (or preference)**](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidation-preference.asp),
  meaning the preferred stock owner will be paid before the common stock owners upon
  liquidation.
- 🄳 A company is in
  [**liquidation overhang**](https://equityzen.com/blog/startup-valuations-and-liquidation-preference-overhang/)
  when the value of a company doesn’t reach the number of dollars investors put into it.
  Because of liquidation preference, those holding preferred stock (investors) will have to
  be paid before those holding common stock (employees).
  If investors have put millions of dollars into your company and it’s sold, your equity as
  an employee
  [won’t be worth anything](https://avc.com/2010/10/employee-equity-the-liquidation-overhang/)
  if the company is in liquidation overhang and the sale doesn’t exceed that amount.
- ☝️ Preferences are
  [notoriously](https://venturebeat.com/2010/08/16/beware-the-trappings-of-liquidation-preference/)

  [complex](https://medium.com/@CharlesYu/the-ultimate-guide-to-liquidation-preferences-478dda9f9332).
  We can’t cover everything here, but it’s worth knowing that investors and entrepreneurs
  negotiate a lot of these details, including:

  - 🄳 The **multiple**, a number designating how many times the investor must be paid back
    before common shareholders receive proceeds (often the multiple is 1X, but it can be 2X or
    higher).
  - Whether preferred stock is
    [**participating**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participating_preferred_stock), meaning
    investors get their money back and also participate in proceeds from common stock.
  - Whether there is a **cap**, which limits the payout if it is participating.

**Does all this matter to you?**
For the purposes of someone like an employee who holds common stock, it is important to
know that investors get paid back first on exits.
Depending on how favorable the terms are for the investor, if the company exits at a low
or modest valuation, it’s far more likely that common shareholders will not receive
anything. If a company exits at a very high valuation relative to what was expected,
liquidation preferences are not going to matter;
in that case, everyone will own valuable stock.

## Equity Compensation Details

In this section we’ll lay out the differences, benefits, and drawbacks of common types of
granted equity.
We explain stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs), which the most common forms of
equity compensation.
If you want to jump ahead, RSUs are more common for larger companies and options more
common for startups.

### Stock options

🄳 [**Employee stock options**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_stock_option) (**ESOs**) are
contracts that allow you to buy shares in the company you work for.
When you buy shares, you are **exercising** the options.

☝️ Options are not the same as stock;
they are only the right to buy stock upon and subject to the conditions specified in the
option agreement.

🚧 Add a tip about how this isn’t at all the same as trading in options on stocks, or
buying stock options (differentiate ESOs as a type of stock option)

🄳 The **strike price** is the fixed price per share at which stock options can be
exercised, as set in an employee’s stock option agreement.
The strike price is generally set lower (often much lower) than what people expect will be
the future value of the stock, which means you can make money when you sell the stock.

🚧 Add real-world example of a famously low strike price that paid off beyond expectations

Sounds great, right?
Well, let’s get into some of those conditions and limitations on when this can work out
well for you—and when it might not.

### Vesting

🄳 One of the most significant conditions is that you usually “earn” rights to the shares
or options over time or under certain events.
This is called **vesting** those rights.
People talk about *shares or options vesting*, or that the *person is vesting* while in a
certain position.

🚧 Re: “People talk about…” Are both descriptions correct?
(Rachel) wonders whether we might choose one or the other for clarity within this Guide,
only marking here that you are likely to hear both.

- 🄳 Vesting usually occurs according to a **vesting schedule**. You vest only while you work
  for the company.
  For example, it is very common to have stock or options vest over a period of four years,
  a bit at a time, where none of it is vested at first, and all of it is vested after four
  years.
- 🄳 Vesting schedules can also have a **cliff**, designating that you must work for a given
  amount of time before you vest at all.

  - For example, if your equity award had a one-year cliff and you only worked for the company
    for 11 months, you would not get anything, since you haven’t vested in any part of your
    award. Similarly, if the company is sold within a year, depending on what your paperwork
    says, you may also receive nothing on the sale of the company.
  - A very common vesting schedule is vesting over **4 years**, with a **1 year** cliff.
    This means you get 0% vesting for the first 12 months, 25% vesting at the 12th month, and
    1/48th (2.08%) more vesting each month until the 48th month.
    If you leave just before a year is up, you get nothing, but if you leave after 3 years,
    you get 75%.

- 🌪 Cliffs are an important topic.
  When they work well, cliffs are an effective and reasonably fair system to both employees
  and companies.
  But they can be abused and their complexity can lead to misunderstandings.

  - The intention of a cliff is to make sure someone is serious about contributing to a
    company for a significant period before they sign an employment agreement.
    However, the flip side of vesting with cliffs is that if an employee is leaving—quits or
    is laid off or is fired—just short of their cliff, they may walk away with no stock
    ownership at all, sometimes due to no fault of their own, such as a family emergency or
    other unexpected event.
    In situations where companies fire or lay off employees just before a cliff, it can easily
    lead to hard feelings and even lawsuits (especially if the company is doing so well the
    stock is worth a lot of money).
  - 🔹 As a manager or founder, if an employee is performing poorly or may have to be laid
    off, it’s both thoughtful and wise to let them know of that well before their cliff.
  - 🔹 As an employee, if you’re leaving or considering leaving a company before your vesting
    cliff is met, consider waiting.
    Or, if your value to the company is high enough, even negotiating to get some of your
    stock “vested up” early.
    Your manager may well agree that is is fair for someone who has added a lot of value to
    own stock even if they leave earlier than expected, and especially if it’s something
    unrelated like a family emergency.
    This is entirely discretionary, however.
  - 🚧 What about how time off affects the vesting schedule?
    Say you take three months of parental leave in your first year.
    Does your cliff extend to 15 months?

- 🄳 Vesting *can* be triggered outside of the vesting schedule.
  [**Acceleration**](http://www.danshapiro.com/blog/2012/04/vesting-is-a-hack/) dictates that
  vesting will be triggered if a company is sold (**single trigger**) or if it’s sold and
  you’re fired (**double trigger**).
  - ☝️ Acceleration is common for founders and not so common for employees.
    It’s worth understanding acceleration and triggers in case they show up in your option
    agreement, but these may not be something you can negotiate unless you are going to be in
    a key role.

### How options expire

🄳 The **exercise window** is the period during which you can buy shares at the strike
price. Options are only exercisable for a fixed period of time, typically seven to ten
years as long as you’re working for the company.
But this window is not always open.

- ❗ Options can expire after you quit working for the company.
  Often, the expiration is **90 days** after termination of service, making the options
  effectively worthless if you cannot exercise before that point.
  We’ll talk more about this, but remember that you’ll need to understand costs and tax
  liabilities and try to plan ahead!
  In fact, you should find out about this when you start, or better yet, before you sign an
  offer letter.
- 🔹 Recently (since around 2015) a few companies are finding ways to keep the exercise
  window open for years after leaving a company, promoting this practice as fairer to
  employees. Companies with
  [extended exercise windows](https://github.com/holman/extended-exercise-windows) include
  [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/blog/2015/12/01/employee-equity-is-broken-heres-our-fix/),
  [Clef](https://github.com/clef/handbook/blob/master/Hiring%20Documents/Guide%20to%20Your%20Equity.md),
  [Coinbase](https://medium.com/@barmstrong/improving-equity-compensation-at-coinbase-8749979409c3),
  [Pinterest](http://fortune.com/2015/03/23/pinterest-employee-taxes/), and
  [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-most-startups-force-employees-to-exercise-their-vested-ISO-options-within-90-days-if-they-leave-rather-than-the-option-to-convert-to-NSOs).
- **A note on advisors**: Options granted to advisors typically vest over a shorter period than
  employee grants, often two years.
  Advisor grants also typically have a longer exercise window post termination of service.
  Typical terms for advisors, including equity levels, are available from the 📥 Founder
  Institute’s [Founder/Advisor Standard Template (FAST)](https://fi.co/contents/fast#).

### RSUs

🚧 Begin with a transition from the last section.
What is the relationship of RSUs to the surrounding sections and to the chapter as a
whole? Are they types of ESOs?
How is a “unit” also an “agreement”?
Are they the most common type of equity, as would logically be understood by presumed
opposition to the section that follows?
Additional thought here that Equity Compensation Details is too broad a chapter heading.
There needs to be a clear relationship between each of these subsections, represented both
by the chapter heading and in transitions between subsections.
And again, because (Rachel has) listed this question elsewhere, why are RSUs separate from
stock options and stock awards and ISOs and NSOs?
Should these all be described together in a single chapter?

🄳 [**Restricted stock units**](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restricted-stock-unit.asp) (**RSUs**)
refer to an agreement by the company to issue you shares of stock or the cash value of
shares of stock on a future date.
Each unit represents one share of stock or the cash value of one share of stock that you
will receive in the future.

🄳 The date on which you receive the shares or cash payment for RSUs is known as the
**settlement date**.

- 🔸 RSUs may vest according to a vesting schedule.
  The settlement date may be the time-based vesting date or a later date based on, for
  instance, the date of a company’s IPO.
- RSUs are difficult in a startup or early stage company because when the RSUs vest, the
  value of the shares might be significant, and taxes will be owed on the receipt of the
  shares. This is not a bad result when the company has sufficient capital to help the
  employee make the tax payments, or the company is a public company that has put in place a
  program for selling shares to pay the taxes.
  - ☝️ But for cash-strapped private startups, neither of these are possibilities.
    This is the reason most startups use stock options rather than RSUs or stock awards
    (another way to grant stock we’ll discuss later).
- RSUs are often considered less preferable to grantees since they remove control over when
  you owe tax. Options, if granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of
  the stock, are not taxed until exercise, an event under the control of the optionee.
  If a company awards you an RSU or restricted stock award which vests over time, you will
  be taxed on the vesting schedule.
  You have been put on “autopilot” with respect to the timing of the tax event.
  This can be a really bad thing if on the date of vesting the shares are worth a lot and
  consequently you owe a lot of tax.
- ☝️ You don’t want to confuse *restricted stock units* with *restricted stock*, which
  typically refers to a [direct award of stock](how-equity-compensation-is-granted), a
  completely different type of equity compensation.

### Less common types of equity

Most employees won’t run into these, but in the interest of completeness, it’s worth
mentioning a few other flavors of equity compensation that might come up.

🚧 So these here, along with RSUs, are different from ESOs?
Are ESOs a “type of equity” as well?
Again, we must establish the relationships between these concepts.
(This is what (Rachel) means when she says “narrative.”
It’s not *story*, it’s transitionary material that helps us learn how abstract concepts
relate.)

- 🄳 **Phantom equity** is a type of compensation award that references equity, but does not
  entitle the recipient to actual equity in the business.
  These awards come under a variety of different monikers, but the key to understanding them
  is knowing that they are really just cash bonus plans, where the cash amounts are
  determined by reference to a company’s stock.
  Phantom equity can have significant value, but may be perceived as less valuable by
  workers because of the contractual nature of the promises.
  Phantom equity plans can be set up as purely discretionary bonus plans, which is less
  attractive than owning a piece of something.
  Two examples of phantom equity are phantom stock and stock appreciation rights:

  - 🄳 A
    [**phantom stock**](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/12/introduction-phantom-stock.asp)
    award entitles you to a payment equal to the value of a share of the company’s stock,
    upon the occurrence of certain events.
  - 🚧 Can we elaborate on what events typically trigger this?
  - 🄳
    [**Stock appreciation rights (SAR)**](https://www.nceo.org/articles/phantom-stock-appreciation-rights-sars)
    give the recipient the right to receive a payment calculated by reference to the
    appreciation in the equity of the company.
  - 🚧 More data on how rare these are?
  - 🚧 And what is appreciation?

- 🄳 [**Warrants**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_%28finance%29) are another kind of option
  to purchase stock, generally used in investment transactions (for example, in a
  convertible note offering, investors may also get a warrant;
  or a law firm may ask for one in exchange for vendor financing).
  As an employee or advisor, you may not encounter warrants, but it’s worth knowing they
  exist. They differ from stock options in that they are more abbreviated and stand-alone
  legal documents, not granted pursuant to a single legal agreement (typically called a “[plan](#documents-and-agreements)”)
  for all employees.

### How equity compensation is granted

🚧 Structure: This should be its own chapter, with the sections of each type of equity
compensation pooled here.
Consider a new chapter after Companies, Compensation, and Stock.
There is repetition here as well that needs to be addressed after restructuring (based on
proximity to other occurrences).

Now for the details around how stock and options are used for compensation.

- Companies can give equity compensation as stock awards, stock options, or RSUs.
  While the intent of each is similar, they
  [differ in many ways](http://joewallin.com/2014/09/13/rsus-vs-restricted-stock-vs-stock-options/),
  particularly around taxation.
  RSUs generally don’t make sense for early stage companies.
  - 🚧 Define stock awards.
- 🄳 If companies do grant stock, it may be **restricted stock**. In this context,
  “restricted” refers to the fact that the stock will be subject to repurchase at a lower
  rate than fair market value or cost, and the repurchase right lapses over the
  service-based vesting period.
  - 🚧 Clarify legalese here.
- Typically, stock awards are limited to executives or very early hires, since once the
  value of the shares increases, the tax burden of receiving them can be too great for most
  people. Instead, it’s more common for employees to get stock options.
- 🔹 At some point early on, generally before the first employees are hired, stock will be
  allocated to a stock [**option pool**](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option-pool.asp). A
  typical size for this is 20% of the stock of the company, but it can be 10%, 15%, or other
  sizes. Once the pool is established, then the company’s board of directors grants pieces
  of it to employees as they join the company.
  Often, the whole pool is never used.
  The size of the pool is not just about how generous the company is with employees;
  it is determined by
  [complex factors between founders and investors](http://venturehacks.com/articles/option-pool-shuffle).
- ☝️ 🄳 Compensatory stock options come in two flavors, **incentive stock options (or ISOs)**
  and **non-qualifying stock options (or NQOs)**. Confusingly, lawyers can’t even agree on
  the names of these two kinds of stock options, so you’ll also see them called **statutory
  stock options** and **non-statutory stock options (or NSOs)**, respectively.
  - 🚧 A diagram with all the terms is likely worth it.
  - ISOs are common for employees because they have the possibility of being more favorable
    from a tax point of view than NSOs (below).
    They can only be granted to employees (not independent contractors or directors who are
    not also employees).
    But ISOs have a number of limitations and conditions and can also create difficult tax
    consequences. More on this below.
- 🄳🔹 Sometimes, to help you lower your tax burden, the company makes it possible to **early
  exercise (or forward exercise)** stock options.
  This means you exercise them even before they vest, which means you become a stockholder.
  However, the company has the right to repurchase the *unvested* shares, at a lower price
  than what you paid, or the fair market value of the shares, if you quit working for the
  company. The company will typically repurchase the unvested shares should you leave the
  company before the stock you’ve purchased vests.
  - 🚧 Explain how early exercise and lowering your tax burden are related.
    Early exercise allows you to buy your shares at the current FMV of the stock, with an
    83(b), you lock in tax treatment on that price vs.
    waiting to exercise, buying at a (much) higher price, and getting slapped with a tax bill
    big enough to make your stomach upside down and inside out.
- ❗ Stock options will expire after you leave a company (typically after **90 days**). You
  might early exercise, or exercise at different times during your employment, depending on
  how much it costs and what the tax implications are.
  More on this below.
- Companies may impose additional restrictions on stock that is vested.
  For example, your shares are very likely subject to a right of first refusal.
  And it can happen that companies reserve the right to repurchase vested shares in certain
  events.

## Tax Basics

When you are awarded equity compensation, you typically also have to pay taxes.
In fact, it can give rise to multiple kinds of tax, depending on your situation, including
federal and state income taxes as well as employment taxes and Medicare surtax charges.
As we’ll see, sometimes you need to pay at different times, and even when you don’t have
the cash.

Now you may be wondering, “what’s the Medicare surtax again?”
Well, you’re not alone.
Given the complexity, most taxpayers aren’t aware of exactly how their
[income tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incometax.asp) is calculated.
It does involve
[thousands of pages](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/04/how_long_is_the_tax_code_it_is_far_shorter_than_70_000_pages.html)
in the
[federal tax code](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2016-title26/content-detail.html) as
well as the intricate diversity of state tax law.
But it is critical to is to understand the different kinds of taxes, roughly how large
they are, and what events “trigger” them so you then owe tax.

This section covers general tax fundamentals:
Roughly how and when different kinds of taxes are calculated, just in case you never
really figured out all the numbers on your pay stub.

### Kinds of income

🄳 You must pay federal, state, and in some cases, local **income taxes** on your **income**,
which is the money you make.

🄳 From a tax perspective, your income is divided between
[**ordinary income**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/ordinaryincome.asp), which includes
wages and salary and interest, and
[**capital gains**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_gains_tax.asp), which is the term
for profit you receive from selling assets, which includes stocks.
One key difference between ordinary income and capital gains is you can sell assets for a
profit or a loss, so this kind of income is taxed differently, with the ability to track
both gains and losses.

🄳 Capital gains are further divided between **long-term** and **short-term** capital gains.
Long-term capital gains are gains from selling assets you held for more than a year.
Although this is a topic
[with plenty of controversy](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-should-capital-gains-be-taxed-1425271052),
the general idea is, if you are selling something you’ve owned for a long time, you can be
taxed a lower rate.

🚧 Can we clarify the term **investment income** too?

🚧 Include a roadmap of all taxation sections.

### Federal taxes

🔹 In general, federal tax applies to
[many kinds of income](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc400.html). If you’re an employee at a
startup, you need to consider four kinds of federal tax, each of which is computed
differently:

- 🄳 **Ordinary income tax** is the tax on your ordinary income, that is, wages or salary
  income, and short-term investment income.
  Taxes on ordinary income and short-term capital gains are the same, so it can also be
  called **short-term capital gains tax** when this tax is short-term capital gains.
  For a lot of people who make most of their money by working, ordinary income tax is the
  biggest chunk of tax they pay.
- 🄳 **Employment taxes** are an additional kind of federal tax beyond ordinary income tax,
  and consist of Social Security and
  [Medicare taxes](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/questions-and-answers-for-the-additional-medicare-tax)
  that are withheld from your paycheck.
  The Social Security wage withholding rate is **6.2%** up to the FICA wage base.
  The Hospital Insurance component is **1.45%**, and it does not phase out above the FICA wage
  base. You’ll also hear these called
  **[payroll taxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payroll_tax)** as they often show up on your pay
  stub.
- 🚧 Review and add more links on SS and Medicare taxes.
- 🄳 **Long-term capital gains tax** is a tax on long-term capital gains that is often much
  lower than ordinary income tax.
- 🄳 **Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)** is
  [entirely separate kind of tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_minimum_tax) that is
  not ordinary income tax or employment tax, and has its own rules and only applies in some
  situations. Many people do not pay it, but higher income earners and people in special
  situations often have to pay very large AMT bills.

☝️ Okay, which of these do you have to worry about when thinking about equity
compensation? We’re sorry to say, but potentially *all of them*, depending on the
situation. That’s why we have so much to get through here.

Now a bit on how these fit together:

- Ordinary income tax applies in the situations you’re probably already familiar with, where
  you pay taxes on [salaries or wages](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc401.html). Tax rates are
  based on
  [filing status](https://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/Determining-Your-Correct-Filing-Status) (if
  you are single, married, or support a family), and on which
  [**income bracket**](http://taxfoundation.org/article/2015-tax-brackets) you fall under.
- As of the 2018 tax year, there are income brackets at **10%**, **12%**, **22%**, **24%**, **32%**,
  **35%**, and **37%** [marginal tax rates](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginaltaxrate.asp)—see
  [Notice 1036](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/n1036.pdf). Be sure you understand how these
  brackets work, and what bracket you’re likely to be in.
  - ☝️ There is sometimes a
    [misconception](https://today.yougov.com/news/2013/01/08/understanding-how-marginal-taxes-work-its-all-part/)
    that if you move to a higher bracket, you’ll make less money.
    What actually happens is when you cross certain thresholds, each additional (marginal)
    dollar money you make is taxed at a higher rate, equal to the bracket you’re in.
    It looks roughly [like this](http://i.imgur.com/uLaJJ5q.png) (created from a
    [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2wkbgz/graphing_one_misconception_about_tax_brackets/)
    on the subject).
- Investment gains, such as buying and selling a stock, are similarly taxed at “ordinary”
  rates, unless they are [**long-term**](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc409.html), which means you
  held the asset for more than a year.
- You also pay a number of other federal taxes (see a
  [2015 summary for all states](http://www.adp.com/~/media/Compliance/2015%20Fast%20Wage%20and%20Tax%20Facts/2015FastFactsALL.ashx)),
  notably:
  - **6.2%** for Social Security on your first $118,500
  - **1.45%** for Medicare
  - **0.9%**
    [Additional Medicare Tax](https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Questions-and-Answers-for-the-Additional-Medicare-Tax)
    on income over $200,000 (single) or $250,000 (married filing jointly)
  - **3.8%**
    [Net Investment Income Tax](https://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/Net-Investment-Income-Tax-FAQs)
    on investment income if you make over $200,000 (single) or $250,000 (married filing
    jointly)
- Ordinary federal income tax, Social Security, and Medicare taxes are withheld from your
  paycheck by your employer and are called
  [**employment taxes**](https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Understanding-Employment-Taxes).
- 🔹 Long-term capital gains are
  [taxed at a lower rate](http://www.fool.com/retirement/general/2015/12/14/long-term-capital-gains-tax-rates-in-2016.aspx)
  than ordinary income tax: **0%**, **15%**, or **20%**. This covers cases where you get
  dividends or sell stock after holding it a year.
  If you are in the middle brackets (more than about $37K and less than $413K of ordinary
  income), your long-term capital gains rate is 15% ([more details](http://taxes.about.com/od/Federal-Income-Taxes/fl/Federal-Income-Tax-Rates-for-the-Year-2015.htm)).
- [AMT](http://fairmark.com/general-taxation/alternative-minimum-tax/alternative-minimum-tax-101/)
  is a [complex part](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc556.html) of the federal tax code many
  taxpayers never worry about.
  Generally, you do not pay
  [unless you have high income (>$250K) or high deductions](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/congratulations-you-owe-the-alternative-minimum-tax-2014-01-14).
  It also depends on where you file, since your state taxes can significantly affect your
  deductions. Confusingly, if you are affected, AMT tax rates are usually at **26%** or **28%**
  marginal tax rate, but effectively **35%** for some ranges, meaning it is
  [higher than ordinary income tax for some incomes and lower for others](http://www.forbes.com/sites/feeonlyplanner/2011/12/16/the-alternative-minimum-tax-sweet-spot/).
  AMT rules are so complicated you often need professional tax help if they might apply to
  you. The IRS’s
  [AMT Assistant](https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Alternative-Minimum-Tax-(AMT)-Assistant-for-Individuals)
  might also help.
  - 🚧 Better links on any of these?
  - 🚧 Explain the terminology of “triggering” AMT.
- ❗ AMT is relevant to you if you’re reading this.
  It is important to understand because exercising ISOs can trigger AMT. In some cases a
  *lot* of AMT, *even when you haven’t sold the stock* and have no money to pay.
  We discuss this [later](#taxes-on-stock-and-options).
- 🔹 Section 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code provides a special tax break for qualified
  small business stock held for more than five years.
  Currently, this tax break is a 100% exclusion from income for up to $10M in gain.
  There are also special rules that enable you to rollover gain on qualified small business
  stock you have held for less than five years.
  Stock received on the exercise of options can qualify for the Section 1202 stock benefit.
  - 🚧 Definition, links, and expansion on this.
    Qualified small business stock?
    What’s that? Is that any stock in a small business?
    How small? What’s a small business in relation to a start-up?
    When does exercising qualify for this benefit?
    When doesn’t it?

### State taxes

State tax rates and rules
[vary significantly state to state](http://taxfoundation.org/article/state-individual-income-tax-rates-and-brackets-2015).
Since federal rates are much higher than state rates, you usually think of federal tax
planning first.
But you also should know a bit about tax rates in your state.

State long-term capital gains rates
[vary widely](http://www.fool.com/personal-finance/taxes/2014/10/04/the-states-with-the-highest-capital-gains-tax-rate.aspx).
**California** has the highest, at **13.3%**, while other states have none.

🔹 For this reason, some people even consider moving to another state if they are likely
to have a windfall gain, like selling a lot of stock after an IPO.

## Taxes on Stock and Options

Now we’ve covered the basic concepts of equity and taxes, here are some messy details of
how they interact.

As already discussed, employees can get restricted stock, stock options, or RSUs.
The tax consequences for each of these is dramatically different.

🚧 Structure: These are not the first things discussed, so again, roadmap of all tax
information (the two chapters) will be helpful.
Transitions!

### 83(b) elections

Okay, this is not a fun one.
As a few cursory Google searches will indicate, a lot of people try to explain it, and
it’s usually still pretty opaque after reading one of these blog posts.
But if you’ve made it this far, some of this should be easier to follow.

- Generally, restricted stock is taxed as ordinary income
  [*when it vests*](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/tax/09/restricted-stock-tax.asp?performancelayout=true).
- 🚧 This is the info that would be helpful to know in Tax Basics, when these concepts are
  introduced. They have to be made relevant to the content.
  (Visualization of tax types can help with this.)
- If the stock is in a startup with low value, this may not result in a high tax.
  If it’s been years since the stock was first granted and the company is now worth a lot,
  the taxes owed could be quite significant.
- 🄳🔹 The Internal Revenue Code offers an alternative that will protect you from this high
  potential tax, called a
  [**Section 83(b) election**](http://acceleratedvesting.com/what-is-an-83b-election-and-when-do-i-make-it-part-1-with-graphic/),
  which ensures that you’ll be taxed on the receipt of the “property” (the stock), rather
  than at the time the stock vests.
  Basically, with a Section 83(b) election, you’re telling the IRS you want to pay taxes
  early, and this can potentially reduce your tax significantly:
  If the shares go up in value, the taxes owed on vesting might be far greater than the
  taxes owed at the time of receipt.
  - ☝️ Why is it called an *election*? Because you are *electing* (a fancy word for
    “choosing”) to pay taxes early in exchange for this treatment by the IRS. Does the IRS
    secretly enjoy making simple concepts sound confusing?
    We’re not sure.
- An 83(b) election isn’t guaranteed to reduce your taxes, however.
  For example, the value of the stock may not increase.
  And if you leave the company before you vest, you *don’t* get the taxes you’ve paid back.
- ❗ You must file the 83(b) election yourself with the IRS
  [**within 30 days**](https://www.irs.gov/irb/2012-28_IRB/ar12.html) of the grant or exercise, or
  the opportunity is irrevocably lost.
- ☝️ Note an 83(b) election is made on receipt of actual shares of stock.
  Technically, it cannot be made on the receipt of a stock *option* itself:
  You first must exercise that option, then file the election.
- If you receive an early exercisable stock option (when you don’t have to wait for the the
  stock to vest), you can make an 83(b) election on receipt of the shares on exercise.
- Section 83(b) elections do not apply to vested shares;
  the election only applies to stock that is not yet vested.
  Thus, if you receive options that are *not* early exercisable (meaning you have to wait
  until they vest to exercise), an 83(b) election would not apply.
- 🔹 Founders and very early employees will almost always want to do an 83(b) election upon
  the receipt of unvested shares, since the stock value is probably low.
  If the value is really low, and the taxes owed are not that great, you can make the
  election without having to pay much tax and start your capital gains holding period on the
  shares.
- 🚧 Clarify here which types of equity compensation the 83b can apply to.

### 409A valuations

🄳 When stock vests, or you exercise an option, the IRS will consider what the **fair
market value (FMV)** of the stock is when determining the tax you owe.
Of course, if no one is buying and selling stock, as is the case in most startups, then
its value isn’t obvious.
For the IRS to evaluate how much stock is worth, it uses what is known as the
[**409A valuation**](http://www.fenwick.com/FenwickDocuments/409_Valuations_Stock_Options.pdf) of
the company.

- 🚧 More on the history and motivation of 409As.
- 🚧 Not yet obvious why this info is part of Taxes.
  Expand the connection b/n the two gestured toward in the opening sentence here.
  Lay out the relationship b/n the FMW and the tax you owe, and the 409A and the FMW.

- The startup pays for an appraisal that sets the 409A, typically annually or after events
  like fundraising.
- 🔹 A company wants the 409A to be low, so that employees make more off options, but not
  low enough the IRS won’t consider it reasonable.
  Typically, the 409A is much less than what investors pay for preferred stock;
  often, it might be only a third of the preferred stock price.
- 🌪 The whole process has been called “quite precise—remarkably inaccurate," by legendary
  venture capitalist Bill Gurley.
  You can
  [read more about its nuances and controversies](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/business/dealbook/valuation-shell-game-silicon-valleys-dirty-secret.html).
- 🚧 More on when 409As happen.
  A 409A does have to happen every 12 months to grant the company safe harbor.
  A 409A has to be done after any event that could be deemed a “material event,” which is a
  fancy way of saying any event that could change the price or value of the company
  meaningfully. Other examples could be if a CEO leaves, if the company starts making a ton
  of money, or an acquisition.

### Stock awards vs ISOs vs NSOs

🚧 Structure: Add transitionary material explaining what this section will contain;
“vs” doesn’t tell us what kinds of differences will be laid out (even though this section
is under the Taxes on Stock and Options heading, it also contains sections that are just
definitions of technical content (preceding) and procedural walk-throughs (next)).

🚧 Structure: Possible transitionary material could include why we have chosen to group
stock awards with ISOs and NSOs, leaving RSUs on their own.

🚧 Structure: What is the relationship between restricted stock awards (or stock awards),
ISOs, and NSOs that makes them fundamentally different as a group from RSUs?
Are stock awards and stock options more similar to each other than they are different from
stock units? If so, fine, and clarify.
If not, restructuring is needed.

🚧 Although we refer to “restricted stock awards” in this section and once in 83b, so
clarify that choice as well.
We refer to “restricted stock” many times but its defining occurrence does not include a
secondary referent of “restricted stock award.”
Considering the immense opportunity for pitfalls and misunderstandings (e.g.
“restricted stock units” are not “restricted stock” but “restricted stock” is "restricted
stock awards")).

- Startups generally decide to give ISOs or NSOs depending on the legal advice they get.
  It’s rarely up to you which you get, so you need to know about both.
  There are pros and cons of each from both the recipient’s and the company’s perspective.
  - 🔸 ISOs cannot be granted to non-employees (like independent contractors).
    - 🚧 Move this detail to defining occurrence of ISO.
- ❗🔹 **When you owe tax**: When you get stock options and are considering if and when to
  exercise them, you need to think about the taxes.
  In principle, you need to think about taxes
  - (1) at **time of grant**
  - (2) at **time of exercise**
  - (3) at **time of sale**
- These events trigger ordinary tax (high), long-term capital gains (low), or AMT (possibly
  high) taxes in different ways for NSOs and ISOs.
  - 🄳 The taxes will depend on the gain between the strike price and the FMV, known as the
    **spread** or the [**bargain element**](http://www.investorwords.com/5414/bargain_element.html), and
    the gain on the sale.
    - 🚧 Explain “gain on the sale”
- We’ll give an overview of the differences between ISOs and NSOs from an employee’s point
  of view. (If you relish tax complexity, you can peruse more
  [here](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc427.html),
  [here](http://www.startuplawblog.com/2013/05/15/incentive-stock-options-vs-nonqualified-stock-options/),
  [here](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/07/esoabout.asp), and
  [here](http://www.startuplawblog.com/2010/08/11/top-reasons-nqos-over-isos/)):
  - **Restricted stock awards**: Assuming vesting, you pay full taxes early with the 83(b) or at
    vesting:
    - At grant:
      - If 83(b) election filed, ordinary tax on FMV
      - None otherwise
    - At vesting:
      - None if 83(b) election filed
      - Ordinary tax on FMV of vested portion otherwise
    - At sale:
      - Long-term capital gains tax on gain if held for *1 year past exercise*
      - Ordinary tax otherwise (including immediate sale)
  - **NSOs**: You pay full taxes at exercise, and the sale is like any investment gain:
    - At grant and vesting:
      - No tax if granted at FMV
    - At exercise:
      - Ordinary tax on the bargain element
      - Income and employment tax withholding on paycheck
    - At sale:
      - Long-term capital gains tax on gain if held for *1 year past exercise*
      - Ordinary tax otherwise (including immediate sale)
  - **ISOs**: You might pay less tax at exercise, but it’s complicated:
    - At grant and vesting:
      - No tax if granted at FMV
    - At exercise:
      - AMT tax event on the bargain element;
        no ordinary or capital gains tax
      - No income or employment tax withholding on paycheck
    - At sale:
      - Long-term capital gains if held for *1 year past exercise and 2 years past grant date*
      - Ordinary tax otherwise (including immediate sale)
- 🚧 Visualize this as a table.
- 🚧 Summarize long-term cap gains holding periods (or internal link).
- ❗ **The AMT trap**: If you have received an ISO, exercising it may unexpectedly trigger a
  big AMT bill—even before you actually make any money on a sale!
  To make matters worse, you probably can’t sell the stock to pay the tax bill.
  This
  [infamous problem](https://medium.com/@barryjk/the-tax-law-that-is-unintentionally-hammering-silicon-valley-employees-894a7b54ba8a)
  ([more details](https://www.nceo.org/articles/stock-options-alternative-minimum-tax-amt))
  has trapped many employees and
  [bankrupted people](http://blog.sfgate.com/dgreenberg/2012/06/22/tax-advice-from-the-dot-com-bubble-beware-of-isos/)
  during past dot-com busts.
  Now more people know about it, but it’s still a significant obstacle to plan around.
  (Note that if your AMT is for events prior to 2008,
  [you’re off the hook](http://www.startuplawblog.com/2009/04/03/whoops-i-didnt-pay-amt-on-my-isos-exercised-prior-to-1108-what-do-i-do/).)
- 🔹 If you are granted ISOs or NSOs at a low strike price, and the bargain element is zero,
  then you may be able to exercise at a reasonable price without triggering taxes at all.
  So assuming the company allows it, it makes sense to early exercise immediately (buying
  most or all of the shares, even though they’re not vested yet) and simultaneously file an
  83(b) election.
- 🔸☝️ As we laid out in the previous section, [83(b) elections](#83b-elections) are elections
  to be taxed on the receipt of property even though you might have to forfeit or give back
  the property to the company.
  You can make an election on the receipt of stock, but you cannot make the election on the
  receipt of an option or an RSU because options and RSUs are not considered property for
  purposes of Section 83(b).
  - 🚧 This may just want to live in the 83b section, since it’s close enough in proximity to
    this info. Again, a roadmap at the beginning of our chapters on taxes can help alert
    readers to the relationships between the sections, so we avoid repetition (among other
    pitfalls).
- 🔸🌪 ISOs are often preferred by startups, as they’re supposedly better for employees from
  a tax perspective.
  This assumes that (1) AMT won’t be triggered and (2) you’ll get low long-term capital
  gains rate by holding the stock for the appropriate holding periods.
  However, often you either run afoul of the AMT trap, or don’t hold the stock long enough
  with the complicated 1 year + 2 year requirement, or the spread at exercise is small or
  zero, so the difference wouldn’t matter anyway.
  NSOs do have a slightly higher tax because of the employment taxes.
  Overall, it’s not clear the ISO is that much better for employees, so
  [many](http://www.startuplawblog.com/2010/08/11/top-reasons-nqos-over-isos/)
  [people](http://www.business2community.com/finance/nsos-better-isos-0826167#fz1HTCiOQxRyTr62.97)
  argue for NSOs instead.
  - 🚧 Clarify "because of the employment taxes"—they are higher for NSOs?
    Why?
- 🔸☝️ This is partly because ISOs
  [can make it harder](http://thestartuplawblog.com/the-problem-with-immediately-exercisable-isos/)
  to meet the long-term capital gains holding period.
  Many people expect early exercise together with an 83(b) election will help them hold the
  stock longer, to qualify for long-term capital gains.
  While this is true for NSOs, there is a murky part of the rules on ISOs that implies that
  even with an 83(b) election, the capital gains holding period does not begin until the
  shares actually vest.
  So, if you want to immediately exercise an option and file a Section 83(b) election, and
  you might have liquidity soon, it’s better if you can have it be an NSO.

## Taxes on RSUs

- If you are awarded RSUs, each unit represents one share of stock that you will be given
  when the units vest.
- Here’s the tax summary for RSUs, followed by some details:
  - At grant: - No tax - At vesting/delivery:
  - Ordinary tax on current share value - At sale:
  - Long-term capital gains tax on gain if held for *1 year past exercise* - Ordinary tax
    otherwise (including immediate sale)
- 🔸 When you receive your shares, you are taxed on their value
  [at that time](http://joewallin.com/2014/09/13/rsus-vs-restricted-stock-vs-stock-options/). If
  you are an employee, this means you may have to write a check to the company to cover your
  income and employment tax withholding.
  Often, for U.S. employees, companies
  [will withhold the tax in the form of shares](https://www.schwab.com/public/eac/resources/articles/rsu_basics.html)
  such that no action is required by the employee at vesting time.
- If you receive an RSU when the stock is of little value, you cannot elect to be taxed on
  the value of that stock when you receive the RSU—you pay taxes at vesting time, based on
  the value of the shares at that time.
- 🔸 RSUs present some big problems in private companies:
  - You will owe tax when you receive the shares, even though they are illiquid.
  - You can’t minimize the tax impact of an increase in value of the underlying shares between
    the date you receive the RSU and the date it is settled.
  - If you are an employee you will have to write a check to the company to satisfy your
    income and employment tax withholding.
- 🔸 RSUs are less attractive than stock options from a tax point of view because you cannot
  make an 83(b) election with respect to an RSU. By contrast, if you receive a stock option,
  as long as it’s priced at fair market value, you will have no income upon receipt of the
  options, and your income tax and employment tax consequences will be deferred until you
  exercise, an event under your control for the most part.

🚧 Visualize this in the same system as the previous section.

## Stages of a Startup

- 🚧 Consider combining this with 409A info (e.g.
  at what stage of a startup do 409As happen or become relevant), and connecting both more
  clearly to the value of stock.
  This section is just floating here atm.

This section is a primer on how companies raise funding and grow, as this is critical to
understanding the value of a company and what equity in a company is worth.

- The stage of a startup is largely reflected in how much funding it has raised.
  Very roughly,
  [typical levels](http://blog.eladgil.com/2011/03/how-funding-rounds-differ-seed-series.html)
  are:
  - **Bootstrapped** (No funding): Founders are figuring out what to build, or they’re starting
    to build with their own time and resources.
  - **Series Seed** ($250K to $2 million): Figuring out the product and market.
  - **Series A** ($2 to $15 million): Scaling the product and making the business model work.
  - **Series B** (tens of millions): Scaling the business.
  - **Series C, D, E, etc.**
    (tens to hundreds of millions): Continued scaling of the business.
- 🔸 Most startups don’t get far.
  Very roughly, if you
  [look at angel investments](http://codingvc.com/valuing-employee-options/), **more than half**
  of investments fail, **one in 3** are small successes (1X to 5X returns), **one in 8** are
  big successes (5X to 30x), and **one in 20** are huge successes (30X+). - 🚧 Why just
  include angel investment stats?
  Can take from Guide to Raising Venture Capital for more general data.
- 🔸 Each stage reflects the removal of risk and increased dilution.
  For this reason, the equity team members get is higher in the earlier stages (starting
  with founders) and increasingly lower as a company matures.
  (See the picture above.)
- 🔹 It is critical to understand risk and dilution to know the possible future value of
  equity. [This article](http://codingvc.com/valuing-employee-options/) from Leo Polovets, a
  partner at Susa Ventures, gives a good overview.
- 🔹 If you’re considering working for a startup, there are a lot of questions to ask in
  order to assess the state of the company’s business.
  Startups are understandably careful about sharing financial information, so you may not
  get full answers to all of these, but you should at least ask:
  - *How much money has the company raised (including in how many rounds, and when)?*
  - *What did the last round value the company at?*
  - *Will the company likely raise more capital soon?*
  - *How long will the company’s current funding last?*
    (This will likely be given at the current burn rate, or how quickly a company is spending
    its funding, so will likely not include calculations for things like future employee
    salaries.)
  - *What is the hiring plan?*
    (How many people over what time frame?)
  - *What is the revenue now, if any?
    What are the revenue goals/projections?*
  - *Where do you see this company in 1 year and 5 years, in terms of revenue, number of
    employees, and market position?*
  - 🚧 Combine with and link to

## Evaluating Equity Compensation

It takes quite a bit of know-how to be able to discuss, understand, and evaluate equity
compensation offers.
If you don’t yet have an offer, see the sections below on evaluating a company and
negotiation.

- 🚧 Okay, so it sounds like Stages of a Startup used to follow this section— “evaluating a
  company” makes the info in Stages of a Startup sound more relevant to the topic as a
  whole. See previous suggestion of combining Stages of a Startup with 409A. If that
  combination can happen, it would then make much more sense to include that new section,
  called, perhaps, “Evaluating a Company,” be moved as a subsection of Evaluating Equity
  Compensation.

- In determining the value of equity, you have to figure out (or, more accurately, make
  educated guesses about) several things.
  Whatever a dollar’s worth is always changing too, of course, so this is not easy task.
  We can start measuring the potential value of equity by doing our best to determine the
  following:
  - *Stock value*: Determined by the value the company will have in the future, and the number
    of shares you own.
  - *Vesting and liquidity*: When you will actually receive the shares and when you’ll be able
    to sell them.
  - *Tax*: Both the purchase and the sale of stock can require that you pay taxes—sometimes
    very large amounts.
    There are several kinds of taxes that apply when you have stock:
    income, capital gains, and AMT.
- 🔹 *Percentage*: Knowing how many shares of stock or stock options you have is meaningless
  unless you know the number of outstanding shares.
  What matters is the **percentage** of the company the shares represent.
  Typically, this number is presented in percent or basis points (hundredths of a percent).
  Some companies don’t volunteer this information unless you specifically ask, but it’s
  always a fair question, since without it, the offer of shares is almost meaningless.

- 🚧 This is all sounding more and more like the roadmap we need to the whole Guide.
  “These are the fundamental concepts in equity compensation that we’ll map out in much
  greater detail in the rest of the Guide.”
  This is basically a summary of everything we’ve already learned, except now we’re told why
  it’s really important to know all of those details and how they fit together into the
  whole picture actionable picture, which is indeed evaluating equity compensation.
- You need to understand the type of stock grant or stock option in detail, and what it
  means for your taxes, to know the likely value.
- In some cases, high taxes may prevent you from exercising your options, and if you can’t
  sell the stock, you could effectively be forced to walk away from it if you can’t afford
  to exercise.
- ❗ If you do get an offer, you need to understand the value of the equity component.
  You need quite a bit of information to figure this out, and should just ask.
  If the company trusts you enough to be making an offer, and still doesn’t want to answer
  these questions about that offer, it’s **a warning sign**. (There are many
  [resources](https://blog.wealthfront.com/stock-options-14-crucial-questions/) out there with
  more details about
  [questions](http://www.inc.com/atish-davda/5-questions-you-should-ask-before-taking-a-start-up-job-offer.html)
  like this.)
- 🔹 Information that will help you weigh the offer might be:
  - *What percentage of the company do the shares represent?*
  - *What set of shares was used to compute that percentage (is this really the percentage of
    all shares, or some subset)?*
  - *What did the last round value the company at?
    (I.e. the preferred share price times the total outstanding shares)?*
  - *What is the most recent 409A valuation?
    When was it done, and will it be done again soon?*
  - *Do you allow early exercise of my options?*
  - *Are all employees on the same vesting schedule?*
  - *Is there any acceleration of my vesting if the company is acquired?*
  - *Do you have a policy regarding follow-on stock grants?*
  - *Does the company have any repurchase right to vested shares?*
- Finally, consider the [common scenarios](#common-scenarios) for exercising options, discussed
  below.

## Offers and Negotiations

Before accepting an offer, you’ll want to negotiate firmly and fairly.
You’re planning to devote a lot of your time and sanity to any full-time role;
help yourself make sure that this is what you want.

☝️ This might be one of your first jobs, but it’s normal to still be anxious about
negotiations even if you’re going through this for the tenth time.
It can be uncomfortable and stressful to ask for things that you need or want.
Many people think engaging in negotiations could get the job offer revoked, so they’ll
accept their offer with little or no discussion.
But remember that negotiations are the first experience you’ll have of working with your
new team. If you’re nervous, it can help to remember why it’s important to have these
conversations:

- Negotiations ask you to focus on what you actually want.
  What is important to you—personal growth, career growth, impact, recognition, cash,
  ownership, teamwork?
  Not being clear with yourself on what things you prioritize is a recipe for
  dissatisfaction later.
- If you aren’t satisfied with the terms of your offer, accepting it without discussion can
  be tough not just for you but for your new company and colleagues as well.
  No one wants to take on a hire who’s going to walk away in just a few months when
  something better comes along.
  For everyone’s sake, take your time now to consider what you really want—and then ask for
  it.
- The negotiation process itself can teach you a lot about a company and your future
  manager. Talking about a tough subject like an offer is a great way to see how you’ll work
  with someone down the road.

A Guide like this can’t give you personalized advice on what a reasonable offer is, as
that depends greatly on your skills, the marketplace of candidates, what other offers you
have, what the company can pay, what other candidates the company has found, and the
company’s needs.
However, this section covers some basics of what to expect with offers, and tips on
negotiating an offer.

### Offers

🔹 Most companies, especially well-established ones, give roughly equal treatment to
candidates. But even so, sophisticated negotiators can often get better offers.

- 🚧 Not sure what “roughly equal treatment” is meant to evoke.
  These would be the sections of this Guide to speak to the varied experiences of people who
  are explicitly expected not to negotiate, and how to deal with that, or point people
  struggling with the rough side of “treatment” to further resources.
  People are taken advantage of, and the knowledge this Guide offers is meant, really, to
  empower. This is a wonderful, wonderful thing;
  why not be explicit about it?
  (Granted this may happen down the road.)

- Many companies will give some flexibility during negotiations, letting you indicate
  whether you prefer higher salary or higher equity.
- Candidates with competing offers almost always have more leverage and get better offers.
- Salaries at startups are often a bit below what you’d get at an established company, since
  early on, cash is at a premium.
- For very early stage startups, risk is higher, offers can be more highly variable, and
  variation among companies will be greater, particularly when it comes to equity.
- The dominant factors determining equity are what funding stage a company is at, and the
  role you’ll play at the company.
- If no funding has been raised, large equity may be needed to get early team members to
  work for very little or for free.
  Once significant funding of an A round is in place, most people will take typical or
  moderately discounted salaries.
  Startups with seed funding lie somewhere in between.
  - 🚧 These points need to be made very clear in Stages of a Startup (or the new chapter
    proposed, combining Stages with 409A. How actually does the funding stage of a startup
    determine how equity is awarded and what it is worth?)

🄳 Companies will often give you a **verbal offer** for the job, to speed things along and
facilitate the negotiation, then follow it with a **written offer** if it seems like you’re
close to a point where you’ll agree.
The written offer takes the form of an **offer letter**, which is just the summary sent to
you, typically with an expiration date and other details and
[paperwork](#documents-and-agreements). If you are ready to accept the terms of the offer
letter, you can sign the offer letter.

Although companies often want you to sign right away, to save time and effort, if you’re
doing it thoughtfully, you’ll also be talking to the company (typically with a hiring
manager, your future manager, or a recruiter, or some combination) multiple times before
signing. This helps you negotiate details and offers you a chance to get to know the
people, the company, and the role, so that you can make the best decision for you.

Things to look for in the offer letter include:

- Title and level:
  What your role is officially called, who you report to, and what level of seniority your
  role is within the company.
- Salary: What you’re paid in cash, in a year, before taxes.
- Equity compensation:
  You know what this is now.
- Bonus: Additional cash you’ll get on a regular basis, if the company has a plan for this.
- Signing bonus:
  Cash you get just for signing.
  Note signing bonuses usually have some strings attached—for example you will have to pay
  it back if you leave the company within 12 or 24 months.

While the details may not be included in your offer letter, you’ll also want to discuss
and get full information on:

- Benefits: All the other perks from the job, including health insurance and retirement and
  snacks.
- Accommodations:
  Other aspects of the job that might matter to you, like time off, ability to work from
  home, flexible hours, and so on.

Some general notes on these components, including
[several by Cristina Cordova](https://twitter.com/cjc/status/984094472190349312):

🚧 There are only three here, so not “several.”
Which come from Cordova?

- Early stage startups will focus on salary and equity and (if they are funded) benefits.
  An offer of bonuses or a signing bonus are more common in larger, prosperous companies.
- Bonuses are usually standardized to the company and your level, so not likely to be
  something you can negotiate.
- The signing bonus is highly negotiable.
  This doesn’t mean any company will give large signing bonuses, but it’s feasible because
  signing bonus amounts vary candidate by candidate, and unlike salary and bonus, it’s a
  one-time cost to the company.
  Keep in mind that the terms of your contract may dictate that you return a signing bonus
  if you leave the company right away.

### Startup offers

Because startups are so much smaller than many established companies, and because they may
grow quickly, a few other things are worth remembering when negotiating with startups:

- **Cash versus equity**: If your risk tolerance is reasonably high, it’s reasonable to ask for
  an offer with more equity and less cash.

  - 🚧 More discussion (perhaps in the intro to the Guide) about risk.
    What is risk? What is risk tolerance and how do I know if I have it?
    Should I be risk tolerant?
    What can I look for in the company to determine whether it’s worth a “risk”?

  If a company begins to do well, it’ll likely “level up” lower salaries (bringing them
  closer to market average) even if you got more equity up front.
  On the other hand, if you ask for more cash and less equity, it’s unlikely you’ll be able
  to negotiate to get more equity later on, since equity is increasingly scarce over time
  (at least in a successful company!).

- Negotiating title and exact details of your role early on may not matter as much in a
  small and growing company, because your role and the role of others may change a lot
  quickly. It’s more important that you respect the founders and leaders of the company.
  It’s more important that you feel you are respected.

### Typical employee equity levels

- 🔹🌪 There are no hard and fast rules, but for **post-series A startups** in **Silicon Valley**,
  this table, based on
  [the one by Babak Nivi](http://venturehacks.com/articles/option-pool-shuffle#market), gives
  ballpark equity levels that many think are reasonable.
  These would usually be for restricted stock or stock options with a standard 4-year
  vesting schedule.
  They apply if each of these roles were hired just after an A round and are also being paid
  a salary (so are not founders or employees hired before the A round).
  The upper ranges would be for highly desired candidates with strong track records.
  - CEO: **5–10%**
  - COO: **2–5%**
  - VP: **1–2%**
  - Independent board member: **1%**
  - Director: **0.4–1.25%**
  - Lead Engineer **0.5–1%**
  - Senior Engineer: **0.33–0.66%**
  - Manager or Junior Engineer: **0.2–0.33%**
- For **post-series B startups**, equity numbers would be much lower.
  How much lower will depend significantly on the size of the team and the company’s
  valuation.
- Seed-funded startups would offer higher equity—sometimes much higher if there is little
  funding.
- 🔹 One of the best ways to tell what is reasonable for a given company and candidate is to
  look at offers from companies with similar profiles on [AngelList](https://angel.co/).
- Leo Polovets created a
  [survey of AngelList job postings from 2014](http://codingvc.com/analyzing-angellist-job-postings-part-2-salary-and-equity-benchmarks),
  an excellent summary of equity levels for the first few dozen hires at these early-stage
  startups. For **engineers** in Silicon Valley, the highest (not typical!)
  equity levels were:
  - Hire #1: up to **2%–3%**
  - Hires #2 through #5: up to **1%–2%**
  - Hires #6 and #7: up to **0.5%–1%**
  - Hires #8 through #14: up to **0.4%–0.8%**
  - Hires #15 through #19: up to **0.3%–0.7%**
  - Hires #21 [sic] through #27: up to **0.25%–0.6%**
  - Hires #28 through #34: up to **0.25%–0.5%**
- 🚧 It looks like there’s a typo in the employee numbers (19 vs 21?). Would be great to get
  the real data.
- Keep in mind much of the above information is heavily biased toward early-stage Silicon
  Valley tech startups, not companies as a whole across the country.

### Negotiation tips

🚧 Consider moving negotiation notes at the top of this chapter to the top of this
section, or connect negotiations early on to the type of offer material presented.
“This is all negotiable.
We’ll disucss negotiation strategies later on in this chapter, but keep in mind that
everything we present here could come up in your negotiations.”

Companies will always ask you what you want for compensation, and you should always be
cautious about answering.
If you name the lowest number you’ll accept, you can be pretty sure the company’s not
going to exceed it, at least not by much.

Some points on negotiating compensation:

- Some argue that a good tactic in negotiating is to start higher than you will be willing
  to accept, so that the other party can “win” by negotiating you down a little bit.
  Keep in mind, this is just a suggested tactic, and not a hard and fast rule.
- If you are inexperienced and are unsure what a fair offer should look like, avoid saying
  exactly what you want for compensation very early in discussions.
  It’s common for hiring managers or recruiters to ask this early in the process, just to
  take advantage of candidates who don’t have a good sense of their own worth.
  Tell them you want to focus on the opportunity as a whole and your ability to contribute
  before discussing numbers.
  Ask them to give you a fair offer once they understand your worth to the company.
- If you are experienced and know your value, it’s often in your interest to state what sort
  of compensation and role you are looking for to anchor expectations.
  You might even share your expectations early in the process, so you don’t waste each
  other’s time.
- Discuss what your compensation might be like in the future.
  No one can promise you future equity, salary, or bonuses, but it should be possible to
  agree what those could look like *if* you demonstrate outstanding performance and the
  company has money.
- If you’re moving from an established company to a startup, you may be asked to take a
  salary cut. This is reasonable, but it’s wise to discuss explicitly how much the cut is,
  and when your salary will be renegotiated.
  For example, you might take 25% below your previous salary, but there can be an agreement
  that this will be corrected if your performance is strong and the company gets funding.
- 🔹 Always negotiate non-compensation aspects before agreeing to an offer.
  If you want a specific role, title, opportunity, visa sponsorship, parental leave, special
  treatment (like working from home), or have timing constraints about when you can join,
  negotiate these early, not late in the process.
- 🔹 If you’re going to be a very early employee, consider asking for a restricted stock
  grant instead of stock options, and a cash bonus equal to the tax on those options.
  The company will have some extra paperwork (and legal costs), but it means you won’t have
  to pay to exercise.
  Then, if you file an 83(b) election, you’re simplifying your situation, eliminating the
  AMT issues of ISOs, and maximizing your chances of qualifying for long-term capital gains
  tax.
- 🚧 Any more specific equity advice in negotiations like this last point?
  Re: vesting or type of option or award?
  Dig for more of this advice elsewhere in the content.
  Might consider a table or visualization of what is negotiable when it comes to equity comp
  and what generally is not.

Some notes on the negotiation process itself:

- 🔹 Although offer letters have expirations, it’s often possible to negotiate more time if
  you need it. How much flexibility depends on the situation.
  Some people will go so far as to say “exploding job offers”
  [are a bad practice](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/adam-grant/its-time-to-eliminate-exp_b_4594222.html)
  or
  [make no sense at all](https://erikbern.com/2016/03/16/exploding-offers-are-bullshit.html). If
  you are likely the best candidate for the position, or the role is a specialized and
  well-paid one where there are usually not enough good candidates to meet the demand,
  you’ll likely have plenty of leverage to ask for more time, such as to complete the
  interview process with other companies.
  For example, software engineering roles in tech companies are like this currently.
- Getting multiple offers is always in your interest.
  If you have competing offers, sharing the competing offers with the company you want to
  work for can be helpful, granted your offers are competitive.
  - However, dragging out negotiations excessively so you can “shop around” an offer to other
    companies is considered bad form by some people;
    it’s thoughtful to be judicious and timely to the extent that it’s possible.
- ❗ Get all agreements in writing, if they are not in your offer letter.
- **Reneging on offers**: Do not accept an offer verbally or in writing unless you’re ready to
  stand by your word.
  In practice, people do occasionally accept an offer and then go back on it, or renege.
  This can put the company in a difficult position (they may have declined another key
  candidate based on your acceptance), and may hurt your reputation in unexpected ways
  later.
- Robby Grossman, a VP at Wistia, gives
  [a good overview](http://rob.by/2013/negotiating-your-startup-job-offer/) of equity
  compensation and negotiation suggestions.

## Common Scenarios

🚧 This chapter seems to come out of nowhere.
Any transitioning language would be helpful here ("Now that you know…"), or moving this
information up (part of Equity Comp Details?). Shouldn’t Documents and Agreements follow
Offers and Negotiations?

Once you have stock options, there are several possible scenarios for exercise.

- **Exercise and hold**: You can write the company a check and pay any taxes on the spread.
  You are then a stockholder, with a stock certificate that may have value in the future.
  As discussed [above](#equity-compensation-details), you may do this:
  - Early, even immediately upon grant.
  - Before vesting (if early exercise is available to you).
  - Sometime after vesting.
  - After leaving the company, as long as the exercise window is open.
    - 🔸 Recall that often the window closes soon after you leave a company, generally 90 days
      after termination.
- **Wait until acquisition**: If the company is acquired for a large multiple of the exercise
  price, you may then use your options to buy valuable stock.
  However, as discussed, your shares could be worth next to nothing unless the sale price
  exceeds the liquidation overhang, since preferred stock is paid out first.
- 🔸 **Secondary market**: As discussed [above](#what-is-your-stock-worth), in some cases it’s
  possible to exercise and sell the stock in a private company directly to a private party.
  But this generally requires some cooperation from the company and is not something you can
  always count on.
- **Cashless exercise**: In the event of an IPO, a broker can allow you to exercise all of your
  vested options and immediately sell a portion of them into the public market, removing the
  need for cash up front to exercise and pay taxes.
- 🔹 Note that some of these scenarios may require significant cash up front, so it makes
  sense to do the math early.
- If you are in a tight spot, where you may lose valuable options altogether because you
  don’t have the cash to exercise, it’s worth exploring each of the scenarios above, or
  combinations of them, such as exercising and then selling a portion to pay taxes.
  In addition, there are a few funds or individual investors who may be able to front you
  the cash to exercise or pay taxes in return for an agreement to share profits.
- Author and programmer Alex MacCaw explores a few more
  [detailed scenarios](http://blog.alexmaccaw.com/an-engineers-guide-to-stock-options#exercising).
- 🚧 Possible visualization of these exercise options.
  A flowmap? “If this, then this” (with arrows).

## Documents and Agreements

This section covers a few kinds of documents you’re likely to see as you negotiate your
offer and sign on to a company.
It’s not exhaustive, as titles and details vary.

- When you are considering your offer from the company, make sure you have all of the
  documents you need:
  - Your offer letter, which will detail salary, benefits, and equity compensation.
  - An Employee Innovations Agreement, Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment
    Agreement, or similar, concerning intellectual property.
- If you have equity compensation, at some point—possibly weeks or months after you’ve
  joined—you should get a Summary of Stock Grant, Notice of Stock Option Grant, or similar
  document, detailing your grant of stock or options, along with all details such as number
  of shares, type of options, grant date, vesting commencement date, and vesting schedule.
  It will come with several other documents, which may be exhibits to that agreement:
  - Stock Option Agreement
  - Stock Plan (sometimes called a Stock Option Plan, or Stock Award Plan, or Equity Incentive
    Plan)
  - Code Section 409A Waiver and Release (sometimes part of the Stock Option Agreement)
- If you are exercising your options, you should also see paperwork to assist with that
  purchase:
  - Exercise Agreement
  - Instructions and template for early exercise and 83(b) election, if applicable
- End of year tax documents
  - 📥 You should receive a form
    [3921 or 3922](https://www.irs.gov/uac/form-3921-exercise-of-an-incentive-stock-option-under-section-422-b)
    from your company if you exercised ISO options during the year.

🚧 Examples of what these all look like.

## Compensation Gotchas

🚧 Strong urging to bring these up to Offers and Negotiations.

These are scenarios that can be very costly for you if you aren’t aware of them.

- ❗ Do not accept an offer of stock or shares without also asking for the exact number of
  total shares (or, equivalently, getting the exact percentage of the company those shares
  represent). It’s quite common for some companies to give offers of stock or options and
  tell you only the number of shares.
  Without the percentage, the number of shares is meaningless.
  Not telling you is a deeply unfair practice.
  A company that refuses to tell you even when you’re ready to sign an offer is likely
  giving you a very poor deal.
- 🔸 If you’re looking at an offer, work out whether you can and should early exercise, and
  what the cost to exercise and tax will be, before accepting the offer.
- ❗ If you join a company right as it raises a new round, and don’t have the chance to
  exercise right away, they may potentially issue you the options with the low strike price,
  but the 409A valuation of the stock will have gone up.
  This means you won’t be able to early exercise without a large tax bill.
  In fact, it might not be financially feasible for you to exercise at all.
- 🔸 Vesting starts on a vesting commencement date.
  Sometimes stock option paperwork won’t reach you for months after you join a company,
  since it needs to be written by the lawyers and approved by the board of directors.
  This usually isn’t a big problem, but do discuss it in your negotiations to make sure the
  vesting commencement date will reflect the true start date of when you joined the company,
  not the time at which the stock option is granted.
- 🔸 If you’re going to early exercise, consider it like any investment.
  Don’t believe every projection about the value of the company you hear.
  Founders will tell you the best-case scenario.
  Remember, most startups fail.
  Do your research and ask others’ opinions about likely outcomes for the company.
- ❗ It may not be common, but some companies retain a right to repurchase (buy back) vested
  shares. It’s simple enough to ask, “Does the company have any repurchase right to *vested*
  shares?” (Note repurchasing *unvested* shares that were purchased via early exercise is
  different, and helps you.)
  If you don’t want to ask, the fair market value repurchase right should be included in the
  documents you are being asked to sign or acknowledge that you have read and understood.
  (Skype had a
  [complex](https://www.quora.com/Which-valley-startups-have-a-Skype-like-repurchase-right)
  [controversy](http://www.wac6.com/wac6/2011/07/skypes-employee-stock-option-plan-worthless-only-if-you-quit-before-2014.html)
  related to repurchasing.)
  You might find a repurchase right for vested shares in the Stock Plan itself, the Stock
  Option Agreement, the Exercise Agreement, the bylaws, the certificate of incorporation, or
  any other stockholder agreement.

## Tax Gotchas

🚧 Strong urging to dole these out to relevant areas in the text.
Some in Tax on Stock and Options, 83b warning in 83b section…

Here are some common, costly errors to watch out for on the taxation side.

- ❗ If you are going to file an 83(b) election, it must be **within 30 days** of stock grant
  or option exercise.
  Often, law firms will take a while to send you papers, so you might only have a week or
  two. If you miss this window, it could potentially have giant tax consequences, and is
  essentially an irrevocable mistake—it’s one deadline the IRS won’t extend.
  When you file, get documentation from the post office as well as a delivery confirmation,
  and include a self-addressed, stamped envelope for the IRS to send you a return receipt.
  (Some people are so concerned about this they even ask a friend to go with them to the
  post office as a witness!)
- ❗ One of the most serious tax-related mistakes you can make is to exercise ISOs without
  first knowing the impact on your AMT obligations.
  If there is a large spread between strike price and 409A value, you are potentially on the
  hook for a very large tax bill—even if you can’t sell the stock.
  This has pushed people into bankruptcy.
  It also caused Congress to grant a one-time forgiveness;
  the odds of that happening again are very low.
  Understand this topic and talk to a professional if you exercise ISOs.
- ❗ If you exercise your options, and your income had been from consulting rather than
  employment (1099, not W-2), you will be subject to the self-employment tax in addition to
  income tax. Self-employment taxes consist of both the employer and the employee side of
  FICA. This means you will owe the Social Security tax component (6.2%) up to the FICA wage
  base, and you will owe the Hospital Insurance component (2.9%) on all of your income.
- 🔸 Thoughtfully decide when to exercise options.
  As discussed, if you wait until the company is doing really well, or when you are leaving,
  the delay can have serious downsides.
