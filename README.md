# The Open Guide to Equity Compensation

## Introduction

### Why equity compensation matters

**Equity compensation** is the practice of granting ownership in a company in exchange for
work. In its ideal form, it aligns the interests of individual employees with the goals of
a company, which can yield dramatic effects in creativity, team building, longevity of
employment, and in the creation of value‚Äîfor the company, for its users and customers, and
for the individuals who work to make it a success.

Companies ranging from two-person startups to
[the Fortune 500](http://fortune.com/fortune500/) have found that granting partial ownership
in a company is among the best methods to attract and retain exceptional talent.
In the United States,
[since the 1950s](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2014/10/02/what-has-happened-to-stock-options/),
[stock options](#stock-options) have been a key part of pay for executives and other
employees. As of **2014**, **7.2%** of all private sector employees (**8.5 million** Americans)
and **13.1%** of *all* employees of companies with stock held stock options ([NCEO analysis](https://www.nceo.org/assets/pdf/articles/GSS-2014-data.pdf)
of General Social Survey data).
Many believe employee ownership has
[fostered technology innovations](https://www.wsj.com/articles/reviving-the-flagging-spirit-of-silicon-valley-1428706671),
especially in [Silicon Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley), from the
[early days of Hewlett-Packard](http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/abouthp/histnfacts/publications/measure/pdf/1976_07.pdf)
to recent examples like [Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook). Dramatically,
the first 3,000 employees of Facebook split roughly **$23 billion** at the time the company
became public ([Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/d6599ae0-5738-11e1-869b-00144feabdc0)).

Unfortunately, the ways equity is granted for compensation, including
[restricted stock, stock options, and restricted stock units](#how-equity-is-granted), are
notoriously complex, with confounding terminology and high-stakes decisions.
If you talk to enough employees and hiring managers, and you‚Äôll hear stories of how they
or their colleagues met with the painful consequences of not learning enough up front.
How an individual negotiates their equity-based compensation or when they choose to make
certain decisions, such as exercise stock options, can have **major positive or negative**
financial outcomes.
If a company fails, an employee may get no value at all for what they own in a company, or
may lose money they paid for the stock or for taxes.
Even if a company succeeds, an employee may fall into
[catastrophic tax pitfalls](#tax-dangers) because they didn‚Äôt properly understand tax
consequences.

Many people learn the basic ideas of from personal experience or from colleagues or
helpful friends who have been through it before.
But it is well understood primarily by tax attorneys, corporate lawyers, and other
[professionals](#seeking-professional-advice). Many are daunted by legalities and tax
planning, a challenge even more acute when faced with a short window in which to make a
key decision, like accept a job offer or exercise stock options.

Although understanding the technicalities of equity compensation does not guarantee
fortune will smile upon you as warmly as it did the early hires of Facebook, we do believe
a good overview can help you [make better decisions](#offers-and-negotiations) and avoid some
of the most common and [costly](#the-amt-trap) [mistakes](#tax-dangers).

### When equity compensation applies

Generally, equity compensation is closely linked to **growth** of a company.
Cash-poor startups persuade early employees to take pay cuts and join their team by
offering [meaningful ownerships stakes](#typical-employee-equity-levels), catering to hopes
that the company will one day grow large enough to
[go public or sell](#ipos-sales-and-liquidity) for an ample sum.
More mature but still fast-growing companies find offering compensation linked to
ownership is more attractive than cash to many candidates.

With the hope for growth, however, also comes **risk**. According to
[a report](http://fortune.com/2017/06/27/startup-advice-data-failure/) by Cambridge Associates
and Fortune Magazine, between 1990 and 2010, **about 60%** of venture capital-backed
companies returned less than the original investment, leaving employees with the painful
realization that their startup was not, in fact, the next Google.
Of the remaining **40%**, just a select few go on to make a large number of their employees
wealthy, as has been the case with iconic companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google,
Facebook, Salesforce, and Oracle.

üå™ Some controversy surrounds the use of equity compensation for high-paid executives.
Public companies offer executives equity compensation in no small part because of a tax
loophole. In 1993, President Bill Clinton attempted to limit executive pay with a new
section of the Internal Revenue Code, 162(m).
Unfortunately, the legislation backfired, as it created a loophole that made performance
based pay‚Äîincluding stock options‚Äîfully tax deductible, thereby creating a dramatic
incentive to pay executives via stock options ([Balsam](https://www.epi.org/publication/taxes-executive-compensation/)).
From 1970‚Äì79, the average compensation for a CEO of one of the 50 largest firms in the
United States was **$1.2M**, of which **11.2%** stock option-based.
By 2000‚Äì05, the same numbers had risen to **$9.2M** and **37%**, respectively ([Frydman & Jenter](http://www.nber.org/papers/w16585.pdf),
Fig. 2).

### Why this Guide?

We have created this Guide to help everyone get a fair shake, understand their decisions,
and save time and effort.
Although it is far from perfect, and still improving, a significant number of experts,
editors, authors have worked to assemble and review it.

We believe you shouldn‚Äôt need a law degree or MBA to understand how you are paid.
You shouldn‚Äôt have to know a lawyer or tax professional to orient yourself on the subject.
And you shouldn‚Äôt have to fail before you succeed.

While [a lot of information](#further-reading) on this topic is just a Google search away,
the best resources are scattered about.
Many blogs and articles focus only on a narrow topic, are getting older, or are on sites
supported by ads or other products.
In contrast, this Guide is written to be:

- **Reliable**: We do not promote any investor, company, or product.
  We link liberally, so you can get more detail and other perspectives.
- **Clear**: We keep things brief and clear, but don‚Äôt over-simplify.
- **Practical**: We include concrete details, advice, and pitfalls.
- **Thoughtful**: We try to give context around the dry topic.
  Some issues are also controversial or just confusing, and we work to cover points of view
  from multiple experts when they differ.
- **Living**: We will keep updating this material, and [welcome your contributions](#please-help)!
  This work benefits from your suggested improvements, requests for clarification or further
  information, and any and all questions.

An early edition of this Guide has received significant discussion and feedback
[on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10880726) and
[on GitHub](https://github.com/jlevy/og-equity-compensation). We thank
[everyone who has helped](#credits) write, review, edit, and improve it, and
[welcome your assistance](#please-help).

### Should you use this Guide?

Our aim is to be as helpful to the beginner as it is for those with more experience.
No matter how much you know (or think you know!)
about equity compensation, you likely run into confusion at some point.

If you‚Äôre an **employee** or **candidate for a job**, some of these may apply to you:

- You‚Äôve heard phrases like *stock*, *stock options*, *strike price*, *ISOs*, *RSUs*, *83(b)*,
  *409A*, *AMT*, or *early exercise* and know they are probably important but are mystified
  by what some of them really mean‚Äîor what they mean for your situation.
- You‚Äôre getting a new job offer but don‚Äôt know how to navigate or negotiate the equity
  component of the offer.
- You‚Äôre joining a startup for the first time, and are overwhelmed by all the paperwork!
- You‚Äôre quitting or are being laid off or fired from a company where you have stock or
  options and are thinking through the decisions and consequences.
- A company you work for is going through an acquisition, IPO, or shutdown.
- You have stock in a private company and need cash.

**Founders** or **hiring managers** who need to talk about equity compensation with employees
or potential hires will also find it useful.
As many entrepreneurs or hiring managers will tell you, this topic is not easy on that
side of the table, either!
Negotiating with and fielding questions from candidates and employees requires
understanding it well.

### A note on fairness

Much of what you read about equity compensation is from the perspective of a single
person. The authors and editors of this Guide have navigated the territory of equity
compensation from the perspective of employees, hiring managers, founders, and lawyers.
We do believe that the knowledge here,
[combined with professional advice](#seeking-professional-advice), can make a significant
difference for **both employees and hiring managers**.

One of the difficulties for candidates negotiating equity compensation is that they may
have less information about what they are worth than the person hiring them.
Companies talk to many candidates and often pay for or have access to expensive
market-rate compensation data.
While some data on typical equity levels have been published online, much of it fails
represent the worth of a candidate with their own specific experience in a specific role.
However, even without exact data, experienced candidates and hiring managers develop
better ‚Äúmental frameworks‚Äù to think about [offers and negotiations](#offers-and-negotiations).

On the other hand, challenges are not limited to those of employees.
Founders and hiring managers also often struggle with talking through the web of
technicalities with potential hires, and can make equally poor decisions when making
offers. Either over-compensating and under-compensating employees has unfortunate
consequences.

In short, both companies and employees are routinely hurt by uninformed decisions and
costly mistakes when it comes to equity compensation, and we strive to cover both sides.

### What is covered?

Covering every aspect of equity compensation is verging on impossible, so we have started

The **current scope** of this Guide is:

- Equity compensation in [**C corporations**](#what-is-a-company) in the **United States**.
- Compensation for most employees in [private companies](#public-and-private-companies), from
  startups through larger private corporations.
- Limited coverage of equity compensation in public companies.

Topics **not yet covered**:

- Full details of equity compensation programs in large, public companies.
  (We‚Äôd like to see this improve in the future.)
- Full details on executive equity compensation.
- The design of equity compensation programs in large corporations.
- Compensation outside the United States.
- Compensation in companies that are not C corporations, including
  [LLCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_liability_company) or
  [S corporations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_corporation). (Equity compensation is very
  different in LLCs than in C Corporations.)

For these situations, see [other resources](#when-to-turn-elsewhere) and
[get professional advice](#seeking-professional-advice).

## Roadmap

### How this Guide is organized

You may wish to read this Guide all the way through, front to back, or jump to a specific
area, depending on your familiarity with the subject.

Equity compensation lies at the intersection of corporate law, taxation, and employee
compensation, and so requires some basic understanding of all three topics.
You might think compensation and taxation are separate topics, but they are so intertwined
that it‚Äôs hard to explain one without the other.

So we‚Äôve laid out key elements of these subjects, from the ground up:

- [**Fundamentals of Stock Corporations**](#fundamentals-of-stock-corporations): What is equity?
  To understand the basics, you need to know how companies organize their ownership and the
  basics of how stock works.
- [**Equity Compensation Basics**](#equity-compensation-basics): What is equity worth?
  The next set of fundamentals are around compensation and if and when you can sell equity
  for cash.
- [**How Equity is Granted**](#how-equity-is-granted): Equity is granted in many forms, most
  commonly restricted stock grants, stock options, and RSUs.
  This covers exactly what these are.

Next is taxes:

- [**Tax Basics**](#how-equity-is-granted): Many of the headaches of equity compensation involve how
  it is taxed. We go back to basics again, this time around taxation, for anyone who needs a
  refresher on the kinds of taxes and tax rates in the United States.
- [**Taxes on Equity Compensation**](#taxes-on-equity-compensation): What kind of equity you have,
  the state of your company, and your decisions around when you exercise and pay tax can
  massively affect how much tax you owe tax.
  We get into these details here.

After these more factual matters, we move on to some discussion on how to think about all
this in practice, especially for employees or candidates, but also of likely of interest
to founders and hiring managers:

- [**Evaluating Equity Compensation**](#evaluating-equity-compensation): Given you have an offer or
  already own equity, how do you think about its value and the tax burden?
- [**Offers and Negotiations**](#offers-and-negotiations): One of the most common times to think
  about equity is when you are negotiating or debating whether to accept an offer.

Finally we cover some additional resources:

- [**Documents and Agreements**](#documents-and-agreements): A bit more on the actual legal
  paperwork you‚Äôre likely to see.
- [**Further Reading**](#further-reading): A curated list of lots more to read on the subject,
  including many that have informed this Guide.

üöß What about a Getting Help section outlining when to go to whom for professional help?

### When to turn elsewhere

Anyone such as a **CEOs**, **CFOs**, or **COOs** who runs a company or team of significant size
should be sure to talk to an equity compensation consultant or specialist at a law firm to
learn about equity compensation plans. **Founders** looking for an introduction to
legalities of running a company may wish to check out Clerky‚Äôs
[*Legal Concepts for Founders*](https://handbook.clerky.com/) as well as talking to their
lawyer. Founders should also lean on their investors for advice, as they may have
additional experience. **Executive compensation** at large or public companies is an even
more nuanced topic, on both sides of the table.
Hire an experienced lawyer or compensation consultant.
There are also other [extensive legal resources](https://www.compensationstandards.com/home/)
around executive compensation.

### Seeking professional advice

**This Guide does not replace professional advice.**

Please [read and the full disclaimer](#disclaimer) and seek professional advice from a
lawyer, tax professional, or other compensation expert before making significant
decisions.

Does that make reading about these details a waste of time?
Not at all. Important decisions rarely should or can be blindly delegated.
This Guide *complements but does not replace* the advice you need get from professionals.
You make the best decisions when you understand things as well as have the support of
professionals.
Even experienced attorneys and tax experts can say things that are confusing to clients,
and it is far easier to work with them when you have deeper understanding yourself.

## Fundamentals of Stock Corporations

When it comes to equity compensation, everything depends on understanding some fundamental
questions:

- What is stock, and how do I own it?
  What are shares?
- Is stock the same as equity?
- What is my equity worth?
- If I have or will get stock at some point, can I sell it?

This requires discussing starting with the basics of how companies and stock work in the
United States.
If you think you know all this, you can [jump ahead](#equity-compensation-basics) to
compensation.

### What is a company?

- üÑ≥ A **company** is a legal entity formed under corporate law for the purpose of conducting
  trade. In the United States,
  [several kinds of business entities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_business_entity#United_States)
  may be formed, or [**incorporated**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_(business)),
  under the laws of a specific state.
- üÑ≥ A [**startup**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company) is an emerging company that
  aspires to grow quickly.
  Once a company is established in the market and successful for a while, it usually stops
  being called a startup.
  - ‚òùÔ∏è The term *startup* is pretty informal.
    It‚Äôs not a legal concept, and not everyone uses it consistently.
    For our purposes, it‚Äôs best just to think of it as the young period of a fast-growing
    company.
  - üöß Groundwork:
    What are good stats on how many people work in startups vs established companies?
- Companies in the US include sole proprietorships, partnerships, limited liability
  companies (LLCs), S corporations, and C corporations.
  - üî∏ This Guide does not cover equity compensation in LLCs, as they are rarely used as the
    choice of entity for technology startups, and equity compensation in LLCs is dramatically
    different from equity compensation in corporations.
    So we‚Äôll focus on the one type of company most readers of this Guide will be concerned
    with: The C corporation.
- üÑ≥ A [**C corporation (or C corp)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_corporation) is a type of
  business entity in the United States.
  Specifically, it‚Äôs a kind of
  [**stock corporation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint-stock_company) with certain federal
  tax treatment.
  Most large companies you‚Äôve heard of, as well as startups that aspire to be large, are C
  corporations. In practice, for a
  [few](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/business/how-delaware-thrives-as-a-corporate-tax-haven.html)
  [reasons](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-most-technology-startups-incorporate-in-Delaware),
  these companies are usually formed in Delaware, so legalities of all this are defined in
  Delaware law.
- Loosely, one way to think about all this is that a company is a set of contracts,
  negotiated over time between people and enforced by the government, that align interests
  of a group of people in creating things customers are willing to pay for.
  A key part of these contacts is precisely tracking ownership.
  Historically, this has been done a few ways, depending on the size and nature of the
  company, but possibly the most effective way when a lot of people are involved, is via
  stock, which we get into next.
- üöß Mention how court cases are settled?
- üöß Define board of directors.
- üöß Define cap table.

### Stock and shares

- üÑ≥ [**Stock**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock) is a legal invention that helps track
  ownership of a company.
  It allows the company to grant ownership to a variety of people or other companies in
  flexible ways.
  Stock is divided into **shares**, and every owner, or **shareholder**, holds a specific number
  of shares. Founders, investors, employees, board members, contractors, advisors, and other
  companies, like law firms, can all be shareholders.
- üÑ≥ Stock ownership is formalized on **stock certificates**, which are fancy pieces of paper
  that prove you own the stock.
  - Sometimes you have stock but don‚Äôt have the physical certificate, as it may be held for
    you at a law office.
  - üÑ≥ Some companies now manage their ownership through online services called **ownership
    management platforms**, such as [Carta](https://carta.com/). If the company you work for uses
    an ownership management platform, you will be able to view your stock certificates and
    stock values online.
- üÑ≥ The [**outstanding shares**](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outstandingshares.asp) are
  the total number of shares at a given point, reflecting how many shares are currently held
  by all shareholders.
  This number starts at an essentially arbitrary value (such as 10 million) when the company
  is created, and thereafter will increase as new shares are added (issued) and granted to
  people in exchange for money or services.
  Outstanding shares may increase or decrease for other reasons too (such as stock splits
  and share buybacks, which we won‚Äôt get into here).
  There is a lot of nuance and complexity in all this, because each part is defined by piles
  and piles of legal documents.
  - üöß What is a good overview on stock splits and share buyback.
    Key resources?
- If you have stock, what ultimately matters is not the number of shares you hold, but the
  **percentage ownership** of the entire company that that number represents.
  To determine the percentage of the company a certain number of shares represents, you
  divide it by the number of outstanding shares.
  Even if you have a fixed number of shares, your percentage ownership will change over time
  as the outstanding shares change.

### Equity

üÑ≥ We say you have **equity** in a company when you have some kind of ownership or likely
future ownership.
For purposes of compensation, people are very rarely granted stock with no strings
attached. Instead, they‚Äôre given stock with additional restrictions placed on it, or
contractual rights that later can lead to owning stock.
Examples include [restricted stock, stock options, and RSUs](#how-equity-is-granted)

‚òùÔ∏è The word ‚Äúequity‚Äù has
[several technical meanings](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp) in accounting
and other financial contexts, but when we talk about equity compensation, it refers to
ownership in a company you work for.

### Public and private companies

- üÑ≥ [**Public companies**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company) are corporations where
  any member of the public can own stock.
  People can buy and sell the stock for cash on public
  [exchanges](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange.asp). The value of a company‚Äôs
  shares is the value you see in the stock market reports, so shareholders know how much
  their stock is worth.
- üÑ≥ Most smaller companies, including all startups, are
  [**private companies**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privately_held_company) with owners who
  control how those companies operate.
  Unlike a public company, where anyone is able to buy and sell stock, owners of a private
  company control who is able to buy and sell their stock.
  There may be few or no transactions, or they may not be publicly known.
- üöß What are public exchanges and how is stock bought and sold in practice?

### Fundraising, growth, and dilution

Many large and successful companies have begun as startups, and in general startups rely
on investors to help fund more rapid growth.

üÑ≥ In order to finance building or scaling their business, startups **fundraise** by selling
shares in their business to [investors](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp) in
exchange for capital.
For startups that aspire to grow rapidly, it‚Äôs likely they will fundraise from investors
called **venture capitalists**.

A startup goes through [several stages of growth](#stages-of-a-startup) as it fundraises
based on evidence that it will make money in the future.

- üÑ≥ As these companies add (or ‚Äúissue‚Äù) stock, the outstanding shares goes up, and the
  percentage ownership of each shareholder goes down.
  This is called [**dilution**](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dilution.asp). That‚Äôs a
  confusing word to most humans, but the concept is relatively simple:
  - Dilution doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that as a shareholder you‚Äôre losing anything-usually, as
    a company raises money and issues stock, the hope and intention is that what you do have
    is worth more.
    The size of your slice gets relatively smaller, but if the company is growing, the size of
    the cake gets bigger.
  - For example, a typical startup might have three rounds of funding, with each round of
    funding issuing 20% more shares.
    At the end of the three rounds, there are more outstanding shares-roughly 70% more in this
    case, since 120%√ó120%√ó120% is 173%-and each shareholder owns proportionally less of the
    company.
- üÑ≥ The [**valuation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)) of the company is the
  present value investors believe the company has.
  If the company is doing well, growing revenue by gaining customers or measuring high
  anticipation for a product or service, indicating future revenue, the company‚Äôs valuation
  will usually be on the rise.
  That is, the **price** for an investor to buy one share of the company would be increasing.
- ‚ùóÔ∏è Of course, things do not always go well, and the valuation of a company does not always
  go up. If the valuation by investors of a company goes down, then the value of everyone‚Äôs
  shares goes down, because other investors and the public are being told that company is
  worth less than initially anticipated, and so will be less likely to put their own money
  into the company or its product.
- When investors expect a company to do better than it actually does, it‚Äôs called
  [overvaluation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/overvalued.asp). Companies may be
  overvalued for a whole
  [host of reasons](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/the-value-premium-puzzle-for-overvalued-stocks),
  and the [consequences](https://hbr.org/2015/12/the-overvaluation-trap) for shareholders (with
  the exception of those who deliberately
  [short sell](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp) their stock) are usually
  disappointing.
- If a company is [undervalued](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/undervalued.asp), those
  who can predict that the market will eventually recognize the company‚Äôs worth can decide
  to exercise any vested shares at the strike price (or buy new shares at a low price
  point), hold on to them, and sell when their value rises.
  These predictions are difficult to make and can never be certain, though there are
  consensus
  [qualities to look for](https://www.nasdaq.com/article/7-easy-ways-to-identify-undervalued-stocks-cm914971).
  Some investors will deliberately seek out and purchase undervalued stock in order to
  support the company (with the hopeful result that the stock price eventually increases),
  called value investing.
  - üå™ Some economists are proponents of the
    [efficient market hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis),
    which states that stocks never receive overvaluations or undervaluations because the
    market responds rapidly to any new available information, and thus perfectly reflects the
    fair value of any stock.
  - üöß The implications of undervaluation or overvaluation are complicated, and we hope to
    [provide more insight](#please-help!) on them in the future.

As a rough illustration of how ownership of a venture-backed company evolves as funding is
raised, a couple visualizations of shares are below.
One is a completely imaginary well-performing startup, and the other is loosely based on
[this careful analysis of Zipcar](http://reactionwheel.net/2018/05/zipcar-fundraising-breakdown.html),
a ride-sharing company that experienced substantial dilution before eventually going pubic
and being bought.
Note that these diagrams are only illustrations and over-simplify complexities such as the
ones discussed in that analysis, but they do give a sense of how ownership can be diluted.

### Stages of a startup

Understanding stock and equity value in a startup requires understanding the stages of a
startup‚Äôs growth and how that affects who owns the stock.

- üîπ At some point early on, generally before the first employees are hired, stock will be
  allocated to a stock [**option pool**](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option-pool.asp). A
  typical size for this is 20% of the stock of the company, but it can be 10%, 15%, or other
  sizes. Once the pool is established, then the company‚Äôs board of directors grants pieces
  of it to employees as they join the company.
  Often, the whole pool is never used.
  The size of the pool is not just about how generous the company is with employees;
  it is determined by
  [complex factors between founders and investors](http://venturehacks.com/articles/option-pool-shuffle).
- The stage of a startup is largely reflected in how much funding it has raised.
  Very roughly,
  [typical levels](http://blog.eladgil.com/2011/03/how-funding-rounds-differ-seed-series.html)
  are:
  - **Bootstrapped** (No funding): Founders are figuring out what to build, or they‚Äôre starting
    to build with their own time and resources.
  - **Series Seed** ($250K to $2 million): Figuring out the product and market.
  - **Series A** ($2 to $15 million): Scaling the product and making the business model work.
  - **Series B** (tens of millions): Scaling the business.
  - **Series C, D, E, etc.**
    (tens to hundreds of millions): Continued scaling of the business.
- üî∏ Most startups don‚Äôt get far.
  According [one analysis](http://codingvc.com/valuing-employee-options/) by
  [Leo Polovets](http://codingvc.com), if you look angel investments, the earliest and smallest
  kind of investment, roughly **more than half** of investments fail, **one in 3** are small
  successes (1X to 5X returns), **one in 8** are big successes (5X to 30x), and **one in 20**
  are huge successes (30X+).
  - üöß What are some stats beyond angel investments?
- üî∏ Each stage reflects the removal of risk and increased dilution.
  For this reason, the equity team members get is higher in the earlier stages (starting
  with founders) and increasingly lower as a company matures.
  (See the picture above.)

### Counting shares

There are important subtleties in how outstanding shares are counted.
We mention the key ways you might hear of or read about in documents:

- üÑ≥ Private companies always have what are referred to as **authorized but unissued** shares,
  referring to shares that are authorized in legal paperwork but have not actually been
  issued. Until they are issued, such
  [unissued stock](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unissuedstock.asp) doesn‚Äôt mean anything
  to the company or to shareholders;
  no one owns them.
  - ‚òùÔ∏è For example, a corporation might have 100 million *authorized* shares, but will only
    have *issued* 10 million shares.
    In this example, the corporation would have 90 million *authorized but unissued* shares.
    When you are trying to determine what percentage a number of shares represents, you do
    *not* make reference to the authorized but unissued shares.
- ‚òùÔ∏è You actually want to know the total issued shares, but even this number can be
  confusing, as it can be computed
  [more than one way](http://www.mattbartus.com/option-grants-fully-diluted-or-issued-and-outstanding/).
  Typically, people count shares in two ways: *issued and outstanding* and *fully diluted*.
- üÑ≥ **Issued and outstanding** refers to the number of shares actually issued by the company
  to shareholders, and does not include shares that others may have an option to purchase.
- üÑ≥ **Fully diluted** refers to all of the shares that have been issued, all of the shares
  that have been set aside in a stock incentive plan, and all of the shares that could be
  issued if all convertible securities (such as outstanding warrants) were exercised.
  A key difference is that this total will include all the shares in the employee option
  pool that are reserved but not yet issued to employees.
  (The option pool is discussed more below.)
- üîπ If you‚Äôre trying to figure out the likely percentage a number of shares will be worth
  in the future, it‚Äôs best to know the number of shares that are fully diluted.
- ‚òùÔ∏è The terminology mentioned here isn‚Äôt universally applied.
  It‚Äôs worth discussing these terms with your company to be sure you‚Äôre on the same page.

### Classes of stock

Stock comes with various legal rights.
Often investors ask for rights to be paid back first in exchange for their investment.
The way these different rights are handled is by creating different
[classes of shares](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/class.asp).

üÑ≥ Two important kinds of stock to be aware of are
[**common stock**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_stock) and
[**preferred stock**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferred_stock). This can all vary from
company to company, but it‚Äôs safe to understand *preferred* stock as stock that has
additional ‚Äúrights, preferences, and privileges‚Äù that *common* stock does not have.
(Yes, indeed, the lawyers
[really talk that way](https://www.americanbar.org/publications/blt/2014/01/04_bigler.html).)
The specific differences can also vary at [each round of funding](#stages-of-a-startup).

Some detail on how this works:

- Investors generally get preferred stock, and founders and employees get common stock (or
  an *option* to buy common stock, which we‚Äôll get to in a minute).
  - ‚òùÔ∏è You‚Äôll also hear the term
    [**founders‚Äô stock**](http://www.alleywatch.com/2013/08/what-is-founders-stock-legally/), which is
    ([usually](https://lsvp.wordpress.com/2008/09/15/what-entrepreneurs-need-to-know-about-founders-stock/))
    common stock allocated at a company‚Äôs formation.
- üÑ≥ Preferred stock usually has a
  [**liquidation preference (or preference)**](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidation-preference.asp),
  meaning the preferred stock owner will be paid before the common stock owners upon
  liquidation.
- üÑ≥ A company is in
  [**liquidation overhang**](https://equityzen.com/blog/startup-valuations-and-liquidation-preference-overhang/)
  when the value of a company doesn‚Äôt reach the number of dollars investors put into it.
  Because of liquidation preference, those holding preferred stock (investors) will have to
  be paid before those holding common stock (employees).
  If investors have put millions of dollars into your company and it‚Äôs sold, your equity as
  an employee
  [won‚Äôt be worth anything](https://avc.com/2010/10/employee-equity-the-liquidation-overhang/)
  if the company is in liquidation overhang and the sale doesn‚Äôt exceed that amount.
- ‚òùÔ∏è Preferences are
  [notoriously](https://venturebeat.com/2010/08/16/beware-the-trappings-of-liquidation-preference/)

  [complex](https://medium.com/@CharlesYu/the-ultimate-guide-to-liquidation-preferences-478dda9f9332).
  We can‚Äôt cover everything here, but it‚Äôs worth knowing that investors and entrepreneurs
  negotiate a lot of these details, including:

  - üÑ≥ The **multiple**, a number designating how many times the investor must be paid back
    before common shareholders receive proceeds (often the multiple is 1X, but it can be 2X or
    higher).
  - Whether preferred stock is
    [**participating**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participating_preferred_stock), meaning
    investors get their money back and also participate in proceeds from common stock.
  - Whether there is a **cap**, which limits the payout if it is participating.

**Does all this matter to you?**
For the purposes of someone like an employee who holds common stock, it is important to
know that investors get paid back first on exits.
Depending on how favorable the terms are for the investor, if the company exits at a low
or modest valuation, it‚Äôs far more likely that common shareholders will not receive
anything. If a company exits at a very high valuation relative to what was expected,
liquidation preferences are not going to matter;
in that case, everyone will own valuable stock.

## Equity Compensation Basics

### What is compensation?

üÑ≥ **Compensation** is what you get in exchange for working for a company.
Some compensation is cash‚Äîyour salary and bonus, if you get one.
Other parts are benefits, like health insurance, family-related protections, perks, and
retirement plans.
But for many jobs, compensation includes a kind of ownership in a company, called equity.
It‚Äôs this last part we focus on.

üÑ≥ [**Equity compensation**](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity-compensation.asp) is
compensation in the form of equity.

üöß What about ‚Äútotal rewards‚Äù?
Links or explanation?

To understand exactly how compensation works, it helps to start at the beginning:
What is a company, exactly?
What is ownership, exactly?
And what is this ownership worth?

### Why give equity compensation?

The purpose of equity compensation is threefold:

- To attract the best talent:
  When a company already has or can be predicted to have significant financial success, the
  most talented people are incentivized to work for the company by the prospect of their
  equity turning into large amounts of cash in the future.
  The actual probability of life-changing lucre may be low (or at least, lower than you may
  think if your entire knowledge of startups is watching
  [*The Social Network*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Network)). But even a small
  chance at ‚Äúwinning big‚Äù can itself be exciting or worth a lot to some people.
- To align individuals‚Äô incentives with the interests of the company:
  Even companies that can afford to pay lots of cash may prefer to give employees equity, so
  that employees work to increase the *future* value of the company.
  At its best, this philosophy fosters an environment of teamwork and a ‚Äúrising tides lift
  all boats‚Äù mentality.
  It also encourages longer-term thinking, which is key for company success.
  As we‚Äôll [discuss later](#offers-and-negotiations), the amount of equity you‚Äôre offered
  usually reflects both your past or current contribution to the company and your commitment
  to the company in the future.
- To reduce the company‚Äôs spending on cash compensation:
  By giving equity, a company can often pay less cash to employees now, with the hope of
  rewarding them later, and put that money toward other investments or operating expenses.
  This can be essential in the early stages of a company or at other times where there may
  not be enough revenue to pay large salaries.
  It can also help recruit senior employees or executives who would otherwise command
  extraordinarily high salaries.

### What is equity worth?

The key question to anyone who owns equity is, what is it worth, now or later?

With public companies, you can usually sell any stock you won outright, so the answer is
relatively easy:
You look up the current market value of the stock.

üöß Mention or link to lockup periods etc.

‚ùóÔ∏è With private companies, it‚Äôs hard to know the ‚Äúreal value‚Äù of stock and stock options.
Because the value of private company stock is not determined by public trades,
shareholders can only make educated guesses about the likely future value, at a time when
they will be able to buy or sell the stock.
It‚Äôs always worth remembering private company stock is simply a legal agreement that
entitles you to something of highly uncertain value, and could well be worthless in the
future, or highly valuable, depending on the fate of the company.

‚òùÔ∏è We‚Äôll discuss the notion of [fair market value](#409a-valuations) later, but even if a
company assigns a value to the stock for tax and accounting purposes, it doesn‚Äôt mean you
can expect to sell it for that value!

### IPOs, sales, and liquidity

üÑ≥ A private company becomes a public company (or ‚Äú**goes public**‚Äù) in a process called an
[**initial public offering (or IPO)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering).
Historically, only private companies with a strong track record of years of growth and
profitability have considered themselves ready to take on this significant step, which
includes a lot of regulatory costs
[in exchange for the benefits](https://www.investopedia.com/university/ipo/ipo.asp) of
significant capital to grow and expand.
After a company goes public, investors and the general public can buy stock, and existing
shareholders can sell their stock far more easily than when the company was private.

Companies take years to IPO after being formed.
Exactly how long has evolved over time, as outlined in
[this Harvard report](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2017/05/25/2017-ipo-report/). The median
time to IPO has been increasing, and was **7.7 years** in **2016** compared to **3.1 years** in
**1996**.

üöß What are the restrictions and regulations on selling stock that affect employees at
IPO? What is a lockup period?

üÑ≥ The ability to buy and sell stock is called **liquidity**. In startups and many private
companies, it is often hard to sell stock until the company is sold or IPOs, so there is
little or no liquidity for shareholders until those events occur.

üÑ≥ A sale or IPO is often called an **exit** or **liquidity event**. Sales, dissolutions, and
bankruptcy are all called **liquidations**.

üÑ≥ A [**dividend**](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp) is a distribution of a
company‚Äôs profit to shareholders, authorized by the board of directors.

Established public and some private companies pay dividends, but this rare among startups
and companies focused on rapid growth, since they often wish to re-invest their profits
into expanding the business, rather than paying that money back to shareholders.
For example, although Amazon is one of the best-performing companies in modern times, it
[has never paid dividends](https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/12/28/will-amazon-start-paying-a-dividend-in-2018.aspx).

### Can you sell private stock?

Liquidity events are the usual way shareholders in private companies sell their stock.
However, individuals may sometimes be able to buy or sell stock (‚Äúgain liquidity‚Äù) in
private companies.

- üÑ≥ In a few cases, you may be able to sell private company stock to another private party,
  such as an accredited investor who wants to invest in the company.
  Sales between private parties like this are also called **private sales** or **secondary
  market** transactions, to
  [distinguish them](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondarymarket.asp) from **primary
  market** transactions where companies directly sell to investors.
- üî∏ While many who hold stock hope or expect they need only find a willing buyer, in
  practice, secondary sales only work out in a few situations.
  In some cases, you may have luck selling stock privately to an individual, like a board
  member or former executive who wishes to increase their ownership.
  You can find further discussion of this topic
  [on Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-do-employees-in-startups-sell-stock-in-the-secondary-markets).
- üî∏ Sales generally require the agreement and cooperation of the company, for both
  contractual and practical reasons.
- üÑ≥ Typically, shares held by an employee are subject to a **right of first refusal** in
  favor of the company, meaning the employee can‚Äôt sell their shares to a third party
  without offering to sell their shares to the company first.
- **Why companies may not support secondary sales**: It‚Äôs important to consider a company‚Äôs
  perspective on secondary sales as well.
  - Historically, startups have seen little purpose in letting current employees sell their
    stock, since they prefer employees hold their stock and work to make it more valuable by
    improving the value of the company as a whole.
  - But former employees and other shareholders often have difficulty initiating secondary
    transactions as well.
    Private buyers may ask for the company‚Äôs internal financials in order to estimate the
    current and future value of its stock;
    the company may not wish to share this confidential information.
    Companies
    [also must consider](https://www.square1bank.com/insights/new-normal-secondaries-409a-valuation-process/)
    whether sales could influence their [409A valuation](#409a-valuations).
  - Secondary sales are also an administrative and legal burden that may not make it to the
    top of the list of priorities for busy startup CEOs and CFOs.
  - In late-stage funding rounds, companies frequently do secondary offerings where employees
    may be eligible to sell a portion of their stock.
- üîπ **Secondary buyers**: Thinking on all this
  [has evolved](http://www.industryventures.com/2014/12/02/employee-liquidity-good-for-private-companies/)
  [in recent years](https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/14/selling-private-company-shares-2-0/).
  Some companies do see value in offering (mostly limited) opportunities for sale.
  [SharesPost](http://sharespost.com/), [Equidate](https://www.equidateinc.com/), and
  [EquityZen](https://equityzen.com/) have sought to establish a market around secondary sales,
  particularly for well-known pre-IPO companies.
  A few other secondary firms have emerged that have interest in certain purchases,
  especially for larger sales from founders, early employees, or executives (parties
  generally in possession of larger shares).
  A company can work with the firm to facilitate multiple transactions.
  These firms include [137 Ventures](http://137ventures.com/),
  [ESO Fund](https://employeestockoptions.com/),
  [Akkadian Ventures](https://www.akkadianventures.com/),
  [Industry Ventures](http://www.industryventures.com/), [Atlas Peak](http://www.atlaspeakcap.com/),
  and [Founders Circle](http://www.founderscircle.com/). The goal of these firms is to make
  money of these purchases, so it will work if they believe the stock has chance of
  significant future value.
  In other words, if your company isn‚Äôt doing well, don‚Äôt be surprised if you can‚Äôt sell at
  all on the secondary market.

### What is private company stock worth?

We‚Äôve now seen how stock in private companies often stock can‚Äôt be sold, which makes it
very hard to say what its value is.
Assuming you have equity in a private company, how can you think about its value?

The intention of equity compensation is to grow the company‚Äîit‚Äôs about incentivizing and
rewarding based on future performance of the company.
So the value of your equity is a reflection of three major concerns:

1. How well the company is doing now‚Äîthat is, how profitable it is.
2. How well the company will perform in the future.
3. How likely it is the company will be valuable as part of another company‚Äîthat is, whether
   it may be [acquired](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/acquisition.asp).

The first concern is relatively clear, if you know the company‚Äôs financials.
The second and third are all a matter of prediction and never certain.
Broadly, it‚Äôs important to understand how uncertain each of these concerns are depending
on the stage of the company.

In earlier stage private companies, there may be little or no profit, but the company may
seem valuable because of high expectations that it can make future profit or be acquired.
If a company like this takes money from investors, the investors determine the price they
pay based on these educated guesses.
Overall, in startups there is a high degree of uncertainty about the future value of
equity.

In later stage private companies, the financials of the company are still known, at least
to some people within the company, and these predictions are often more certain.

## How Equity is Granted

In this section we‚Äôll lay out how equity is granted in practice, including the
differences, benefits, and drawbacks of common types of equity.
We explain restricted stock awards, stock options, and restricted stock units (RSUs),
which are the most common forms of equity compensation, as well as a few less common ones.
While the intent of each kind of equity grant is similar, they differ in many ways,
particularly around taxation, as [covered later](#taxes-on-equity-compensation).

The type of equity you get depends on the company, and in some (relatively rare) cases can
be negotiated, but in general, RSUs are more common for larger companies and options more
common for startups.

### Restricted stock awards

The most obvious approach to equity compensation would be for the company just to give
someone stock.
In practice, it turns out a company will only want to do this in certain situations, and
even so, this is actually one of the least common ways to get equity.
But we mention it first, since it‚Äôs the simplest form of equity compensation.

- üÑ≥ A **restricted stock award** is when a company grants someone stock as a form of
  compensation. The stock awarded has additional conditions on it so is called **restricted
  stock**. *Restricted* here refers to the fact that the stock will be subject to repurchase
  at a lower rate than fair market value or cost, and the repurchase right lapses over the
  service-based vesting period.
  Restricted stock awards may also be called simply **stock awards** or **stock grants**.
  - üöß Clarify legalese while still being precise?
- ‚òùÔ∏è Restricted stock awards are not the same thing as [restricted stock units](#rsus), even
  though they sound similar.
- Typically, stock awards are limited to executives or very early hires, since once the
  value of the shares increases, the tax burden of receiving them can be too great for most
  people. Usually, instead of restricted stock, an employee will get stock options.

### Stock options

The most common way early-stage companies grant equity is through stock options.
They get pretty complicated, and much of this Guide is dedicated to explaining those
details.

üÑ≥ **[Stock options](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_stock_option)** are contracts that
allow you to buy shares in the company you work for at a certain price.
More formally, they are known as **employee stock options (or ESOs)**. When you buy shares,
you are **exercising** the options.

‚òùÔ∏è **‚ÄúStock options‚Äù is a confusing term.**
In investment, an *option* is a right (but not an obligation) to buy something at a
certain price within some time frame.
You‚Äôll often
[see ‚Äústock options‚Äù discussed](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockoption.asp) in the
context of investment.
What investors in financial markets call *stock options* are indeed options on stock, but
they are not *employee* stock options.
In this Guide, and most likely in any conversation you have with an employer, anyone who
says ‚Äústock options‚Äù will be referring to employee stock options.

üöß Note this is not the same as ESPPs.

‚òùÔ∏è Stock options are not the same as stock;
they are only the *right to buy stock* at a certain price and with conditions specified in
the stock option agreement.
We‚Äôll get into these conditions next.
If you have stock options, you are not a shareholder until you exercise your option and
purchase your stock.

üÑ≥ The **strike price** is the fixed price per share at which stock options can be
exercised, as set in an employee‚Äôs stock option agreement.
The strike price is generally set lower (often much lower) than what people expect will be
the future value of the stock, which means you can make money when you sell the stock.

‚òùÔ∏è Those with economics degrees or familiar with stock trading will tell you about the
[**Black-Scholes model**](https://www.investopedia.com/university/options-pricing/black-scholes-model.asp),
a general mathematical model for determining the value of options.
While theoretically sound, this does not have as much practical application in the context
of employee stock options.

üöß Any real-world examples of how low strike price has led to big payoffs?

### Vesting and cliffs

üÑ≥ One of the most significant conditions on stock and stock option awards is that you
usually ‚Äúearn‚Äù rights to the shares or stock options over time or under certain events.
The process of incrementally gaining ownership is called **vesting**. (People may refer to
*shares or options* vesting, or say that a *person* is vesting while in a certain
position.)

üÑ≥ In the majority of cases, vesting occurs incrementally over time, according to a
**vesting schedule**. You vest only while you work for the company.
If you leave immediately, you get no equity, and if you stay for years, you get most or
all of it.

üÑ≥ When vesting occurs because of an event, it is called **accelerated vesting (or
acceleration)**. For example, full vesting may be immediate if a company is acquired.

üÑ≥ Vesting schedules can also have a **cliff**, designating that you must work for a given
amount of time before you vest at all.

- For example, if your equity award had a one-year cliff and you only worked for the company
  for 11 months, you would not get anything, since you haven‚Äôt vested in any part of your
  award. Similarly, if the company is sold within a year, depending on what your paperwork
  says, you may also receive nothing on the sale of the company.
- A very common vesting schedule is vesting over **4 years**, with a **1 year** cliff.
  This means you get 0% vesting for the first 12 months, 25% vesting at the 12th month, and
  1/48th (2.08%) more vesting each month until the 48th month.
  If you leave just before a year is up, you get nothing, but if you leave after 3 years,
  you get 75%.

- üå™ Cliffs are an important topic.
  When they work well, cliffs are an effective and reasonably fair system to both employees
  and companies.
  But they can be abused and their complexity can lead to misunderstandings.

  - The intention of a cliff is to make sure someone is serious about contributing to a
    company for a significant period before they sign an employment agreement.
    However, the flip side of vesting with cliffs is that if an employee is leaving‚Äîquits or
    is laid off or is fired‚Äîjust short of their cliff, they may walk away with no stock
    ownership at all, sometimes due to no fault of their own, such as a family emergency or
    other unexpected event.
    In situations where companies fire or lay off employees just before a cliff, it can easily
    lead to hard feelings and even lawsuits (especially if the company is doing so well the
    stock is worth a lot of money).
  - üîπ As a manager or founder, if an employee is performing poorly or may have to be laid
    off, it‚Äôs both thoughtful and wise to let them know of that well before their cliff.
  - üîπ As an employee, if you‚Äôre leaving or considering leaving a company before your vesting
    cliff is met, consider waiting.
    Or, if your value to the company is high enough, even negotiating to get some of your
    stock ‚Äúvested up‚Äù early.
    Your manager may well agree that is is fair for someone who has added a lot of value to
    own stock even if they leave earlier than expected, and especially if it‚Äôs something
    unrelated like a family emergency.
    This is entirely discretionary, however.
  - üöß How does taking time off, for example a leave of absence, affect the vesting schedule?

- üÑ≥ Vesting may be triggered outside of the vesting schedule, depending on the terms of an
  agreement. [Accelerated vesting](http://www.danshapiro.com/blog/2012/04/vesting-is-a-hack/)
  is a stipulation that vesting will be triggered if a company is sold (**single trigger**)
  or if it‚Äôs sold and you‚Äôre fired (**double trigger**).
  - ‚òùÔ∏è Acceleration is common for founders and not so common for employees.
    It‚Äôs worth understanding acceleration and triggers in case they show up in your option
    agreement, but these may not be something you can negotiate unless you are going to be in
    a key role.
- Companies may impose additional restrictions on stock that is vested.
  For example, your shares are very likely subject to a right of first refusal.
  And it can happen that companies reserve the right to repurchase vested shares in certain
  events.
  - üöß Can we give any examples here?

### How options expire

üÑ≥ The **exercise window** is the period during which you can buy shares at the strike
price. Options are only exercisable for a fixed period of time, until they **expire**,
typically seven to ten years as long as you‚Äôre working for the company.
But this window is not always open.

- ‚ùó **Expiration after termination**: Options can expire after you quit working for the
  company. Often, the expiration is **90 days** after termination of service, making the
  options effectively worthless if you cannot exercise before that point.
  As we‚Äôll [get](#taxes-on-iso-and-nsos) [into](#the-amt-trap) later, you need to understand costs
  and tax liabilities of exercise and to plan ahead.
  In fact, you can find out when you are granted the options, or better yet, before you sign
  an offer letter.
- üîπ **Longer exercise windows**: Recently (since around 2015) a few companies are finding
  ways to keep the exercise window open for years after leaving a company, promoting this
  practice as fairer to employees.
  Companies with
  [extended exercise windows](https://github.com/holman/extended-exercise-windows) include
  [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/blog/2015/12/01/employee-equity-is-broken-heres-our-fix/),
  [Clef](https://github.com/clef/handbook/blob/master/Hiring%20Documents/Guide%20to%20Your%20Equity.md),
  [Coinbase](https://medium.com/@barmstrong/improving-equity-compensation-at-coinbase-8749979409c3),
  [Pinterest](http://fortune.com/2015/03/23/pinterest-employee-taxes/), and
  [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-most-startups-force-employees-to-exercise-their-vested-ISO-options-within-90-days-if-they-leave-rather-than-the-option-to-convert-to-NSOs).
- üå™ **The exercise window debate**: Whether to have extended exercise windows
  [has](https://triplebyte.com/blog/extending-stock-option-exercise-window-guide#.12rv7ovrv)
  [been](http://stockoptioncounsel.com/blog/nc7go8ivzxb1el5rhv6nltrjan0n2t/2017/3/6)
  [debated](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9254299) at significant length.
  The key considerations:
  - Everyone agrees that employees holding stock options with an expiring window often have to
    make a painful choice if they wish to leave:
    Pay to exercise and for a substantial (perhaps five- to seven-figure) tax bill (possibly
    looking for [secondary liquidity or a loan](#can-you-sell-private-stock))‚Äîor walk away from
    the options.
  - Many who have been in this situation
    [argue](https://triplebyte.com/blog/fixing-the-inequity-of-startup-equity)
    [forcefully](https://zachholman.com/posts/fuck-your-90-day-exercise-window/) against its
    fairness, as an employee can help grow the value of a company substantially, often at
    lower salary, but end up with no ownership in exchange, because they‚Äôre not willing or
    able to stay for the several years [typically needed](#ipos-sales-and-liquidity) for an IPO
    or sale.
  - On the other side, a few companies or investors
    [stand by the existing system](https://a16z.com/2016/06/23/options-timing/), arguing that it
    is better to incentivize people not to leave a company, or that long windows effectively
    transfer wealth from employees who commit long term to those who leave.
  - As a side note, there is also an argument that it‚Äôs a legal requirement of ISOs to have a
    90-day exercise window.
    This is technically true but misleading, as it‚Äôs possible still to give employees the
    ability lawfully by changing the nature of the options (as illustrated by many companies
    now choosing to do).
  - On balance, it seems many people didn‚Äôt understand the nuances of this before joining
    companies in the past, but with the risks of short exercise windows for employees becoming
    more widely known, the recent trend has shifted to longer exercise windows.
    As an employee or a founder, it is both fair and wiser to understand and negotiate these
    things up front, and avoid unfortunate surprises.
- **A note on advisors**: Options granted to advisors typically vest over a shorter period than
  employee grants, often two years.
  Advisor grants also typically have a longer exercise window post termination of service.
  Typical terms for advisors, including equity levels, are available from the Founder
  Institute‚Äôs üì• [Founder/Advisor Standard Template (FAST)](https://fi.co/contents/fast#).

### Kinds of stock options

‚òùÔ∏è üÑ≥ Compensatory stock options come in two flavors, **incentive stock options (or ISOs)**
and **non-qualifying stock options (or NQOs, or NSQOs)**. Confusingly, lawyers can‚Äôt even
agree on the names of these two kinds of stock options, so you‚Äôll also see them called
**statutory stock options** and **non-statutory stock options (or NSOs)**, respectively.

üöß Infographic:
A diagram with all the terms is likely worth it.

ISOs are common for employees because they have the possibility of being more favorable
from a tax point of view than NSOs.
They can only be granted to employees (not independent contractors or directors who are
not also employees).
But ISOs have a number of limitations and conditions and can also create difficult tax
consequences. We‚Äôll get into all this [after we cover taxes](#taxes-on-isos-and-nsos).

### Early exercise

üÑ≥üîπ Sometimes, to help you lower your tax burden, the company makes it possible to **early
exercise (or forward exercise)** stock options.
This means you exercise them even before they vest, which means you become a stockholder
right away. This will have [tax implications](#83b-elections).

üî∏ However, the company has the right to repurchase the *unvested* shares, at a lower
price than what you paid, or the fair market value of the shares, if you quit working for
the company. The company will typically repurchase the unvested shares should you leave
the company before the stock you‚Äôve purchased vests.

### RSUs

While stock options are the most common form of equity compensation in smaller private
companies, RSUs have become the most common type of equity award for public and large
private companies.
Facebook pioneered the use of RSUs as a private company to allow it to avoid having to
register as a public company earlier.

üöß Why? More links on history of RSUs and Facebook story?

üÑ≥ [**Restricted stock units**](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restricted-stock-unit.asp) (**RSUs**)
refer to an agreement by the company to issue you shares of stock or the cash value of
shares of stock on a future date.
Each unit represents one share of stock or the cash value of one share of stock that you
will receive in the future.
(They‚Äôre called *units* since they are not stock or stock options, but another thing
altogether that is contractually linked to the value of stock.)

üÑ≥ The date on which you receive the shares or cash payment for RSUs is known as the
**settlement date**.

- üî∏ RSUs may vest according to a vesting schedule.
  The settlement date may be the time-based vesting date or a later date based on, for
  instance, the date of a company‚Äôs IPO.
- RSUs are difficult in a startup or early stage company because when the RSUs vest, the
  value of the shares might be significant, and taxes will be owed on the receipt of the
  shares. This is not a bad result when the company has sufficient capital to help the
  employee make the tax payments, or the company is a public company that has put in place a
  program for selling shares to pay the taxes.
  - ‚òùÔ∏è But for cash-strapped private startups, neither of these are possibilities.
    This is the reason most startups use stock options rather than RSUs or stock awards
    (another way to grant stock we‚Äôll discuss later).
- RSUs are often considered less preferable to grantees since they remove control over when
  you owe tax. Options, if granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of
  the stock, are not taxed until exercise, an event under the control of the optionee.
  If a company awards you an RSU or restricted stock award which vests over time, you will
  be taxed on the vesting schedule.
  You have been put on ‚Äúautopilot‚Äù with respect to the timing of the tax event.
  This can be a really bad thing if on the date of vesting the shares are worth a lot and
  consequently you owe a lot of tax.
- ‚òùÔ∏è You don‚Äôt want to confuse *restricted stock units* with *restricted stock*, which
  typically refers to a [direct award of stock](how-equity-compensation-is-granted), a
  completely different type of equity compensation.

### Less common types of equity

We‚Äôll finish our tour of the ways equity can be granted with some other, less common kinds
of equity. Most employees won‚Äôt run into these, but in the interest of completeness, it‚Äôs
worth mentioning a few other flavors of equity compensation that you may run into.

- üÑ≥ **Phantom equity** is a type of compensation award that references equity, but does not
  entitle the recipient to actual equity in the business.
  These awards come under a variety of different monikers, but the key to understanding them
  is knowing that they are really just cash bonus plans, where the cash amounts are
  determined by reference to a company‚Äôs stock.
  Phantom equity can have significant value, but may be perceived as less valuable by
  workers because of the contractual nature of the promises.
  Phantom equity plans can be set up as purely discretionary bonus plans, which is less
  attractive than owning a piece of something.
  Two examples of phantom equity are phantom stock and stock appreciation rights:

  - üÑ≥ A
    [**phantom stock**](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/12/introduction-phantom-stock.asp)
    award entitles you to a payment equal to the value of a share of the company‚Äôs stock,
    upon the occurrence of certain events.
  - üöß Can we elaborate on what events typically trigger this?
  - üÑ≥
    [**Stock appreciation rights (SAR)**](https://www.nceo.org/articles/phantom-stock-appreciation-rights-sars)
    give the recipient the right to receive a payment calculated by reference to the
    appreciation in the equity of the company.
  - üöß More data on how rare these are?
    And what is appreciation?

- üÑ≥ [**Warrants**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_%28finance%29) are another kind of option
  to purchase stock, generally used in investment transactions (for example, in a
  convertible note offering, investors may also get a warrant;
  or a law firm may ask for one in exchange for vendor financing).
  As an employee or advisor, you may not encounter warrants, but it‚Äôs worth knowing they
  exist. They differ from stock options in that they are more abbreviated and stand-alone
  legal documents, not granted pursuant to a single legal agreement (typically called a ‚Äú[plan](#documents-and-agreements)‚Äù)
  for all employees.

## Tax Basics

When you are awarded equity compensation, you typically also have to pay taxes.
In fact, it can give rise to multiple kinds of tax, depending on your situation, including
federal and state income taxes as well as employment taxes and Medicare surtax charges.
As we‚Äôll see, sometimes you need to pay at different times, and even when you don‚Äôt have
the cash.

Now you may be wondering, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the Medicare surtax again?‚Äù
Well, you‚Äôre not alone.
Given the complexity, most taxpayers aren‚Äôt aware of exactly how their
[income tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incometax.asp) is calculated.
It does involve
[thousands of pages](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/04/how_long_is_the_tax_code_it_is_far_shorter_than_70_000_pages.html)
in the
[federal tax code](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2016-title26/content-detail.html) as
well as the intricate diversity of state tax law.
But it is critical to is to understand the different kinds of taxes, roughly how large
they are, and what events ‚Äútrigger‚Äù them so you then owe tax.

This section covers general tax fundamentals:
Roughly how and when different kinds of taxes are calculated, just in case you never
really figured out all the numbers on your pay stub.

‚òùÔ∏è If you‚Äôre already familiar with tax terminology, this section may not have any major
surprises. But for those who are not used to it, watch out:
Many terms sound like regular English, but they‚Äôre not. *Ordinary income*, *long-term* and
*short-term*, *election*, *qualified small business* and other phrases have very specific
meanings we‚Äôll do our best to spell out.

### Kinds of income

üÑ≥ You must pay federal, state, and in some cases, local **income taxes** on your **income**,
which is the money you make.

üÑ≥ From a tax perspective, your income is divided between
[**ordinary income**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/ordinaryincome.asp), which includes
wages and salary and interest, and
[**capital gains**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_gains_tax.asp), which is the term
for profit you receive from selling assets, which includes stocks.
One key difference between ordinary income and capital gains is you can sell assets for a
profit or a loss, so this kind of income is taxed differently, with the ability to track
both gains and losses.

üÑ≥ Capital gains are further divided between **long-term** and **short-term** capital gains.
Long-term capital gains are gains from selling assets, such as stock, a business, a house,
or land, that you held for more than a year.
Although this is a topic
[with plenty of controversy](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-should-capital-gains-be-taxed-1425271052),
the general idea is, if you are selling something you‚Äôve owned for a long time, you can be
taxed a lower rate.

All these rates
[have evolved over time](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-are-capital-gains-taxed)
based on economic and political factors, so you can be confident they will vary in the
future.

üì∞ In 2017, congress passed the
[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Cuts_and_Jobs_Act_of_2017),
which
[reduced capital gains taxes](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/your-simple-guide-to-the-new-capital-gains-tax-rates-2018-04-16)
for most individuals for the **2018** tax year.

üöß Can we clarify the term **investment income** too?

### Federal taxes

üîπ In general, federal tax applies to
[many kinds of income](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc400.html). If you‚Äôre an employee at a
startup, you need to consider four kinds of federal tax, each of which is computed
differently:

- üÑ≥ **Ordinary income tax** is the tax on your ordinary income, that is, wages or salary
  income, and short-term investment income.
  Taxes on ordinary income and short-term capital gains are the same, so it can also be
  called **short-term capital gains tax** when this tax is short-term capital gains.
  For a lot of people who make most of their money by working, ordinary income tax is the
  biggest chunk of tax they pay.
- üÑ≥ **Employment taxes** are an additional kind of federal tax beyond ordinary income tax,
  and consist of Social Security and
  [Medicare taxes](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/questions-and-answers-for-the-additional-medicare-tax)
  that are withheld from your paycheck.
  The Social Security wage withholding rate is **6.2%** up to the FICA wage base.
  The Hospital Insurance component is **1.45%**, and it does not phase out above the FICA wage
  base. You‚Äôll also hear these called
  **[payroll taxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payroll_tax)** as they often show up on your pay
  stub.
- üöß Review and add more links on SS and Medicare taxes.
- üÑ≥ **Long-term capital gains tax** is a tax on long-term capital gains that is often much
  lower than ordinary income tax.
- üÑ≥ **Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)** is
  [entirely separate kind of tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_minimum_tax) that is
  not ordinary income tax or employment tax, and has its own rules and only applies in some
  situations. Many people do not pay it, but higher income earners and people in special
  situations often have to pay very large AMT bills.
  - üöß What is the history and motivation of AMT?

‚òùÔ∏è Okay, which of these do you have to worry about when thinking about equity
compensation? We‚Äôre sorry to say, but potentially *all of them*, depending on the
situation. That‚Äôs why we have a lot to cover here.

Now a bit on how these fit together:

- Ordinary income tax applies in the situations you‚Äôre probably already familiar with, where
  you pay taxes on [salaries or wages](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc401.html). Tax rates are
  based on [filing status](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/choosing-the-correct-filing-status) (if
  you are single, married, or support a family), and on which
  [**income bracket**](https://taxfoundation.org/2018-tax-brackets) you fall under.
- **Income brackets:**
  For ordinary income, as of the **2018** tax year, there are income brackets at **10%**, **12%**,
  **22%**, **24%**, **32%**, **35%**, and **37%**
  [marginal tax rates](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginaltaxrate.asp)‚Äîsee
  [Notice 1036](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/n1036.pdf) or
  [this summary](https://files.taxfoundation.org/20180207142513/TaxFoundation-FF567-Updated.pdf).
  Be sure you understand how these brackets work, and what bracket you‚Äôre likely to be in.
  - ‚òùÔ∏è There is sometimes a
    [misconception](https://today.yougov.com/news/2013/01/08/understanding-how-marginal-taxes-work-its-all-part/)
    that if you move to a higher bracket, you‚Äôll make less money.
    What actually happens is when you cross certain thresholds, each additional (marginal)
    dollar money you make is taxed at a higher rate, equal to the bracket you‚Äôre in.
    After you earn more than your deduction, on which you pay no tax, your post-tax income
    looks like the diagram above.
    (More discussion on such misconceptions are in
    [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2wkbgz/graphing_one_misconception_about_tax_brackets/).)
- Investment gains, such as buying and selling a stock, are similarly taxed at ‚Äúordinary‚Äù
  rates, unless they are [**long-term**](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc409.html), which means you
  held the asset for more than a year.
- üì• You also pay a number of other federal taxes (see a
  [2018 summary for all states](https://www.adp.com/tools-and-resources/compliance-connection/state-taxes/2018-fast-wage-and-tax-facts.aspx)),
  notably:
  - **6.2%** for Social Security on your first $118,500
  - **1.45%** for Medicare
  - **0.9%**
    [Additional Medicare Tax](https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Questions-and-Answers-for-the-Additional-Medicare-Tax)
    on income over $200,000 (single) or $250,000 (married filing jointly)
  - **3.8%**
    [Net Investment Income Tax](https://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/Net-Investment-Income-Tax-FAQs)
    on investment income if you make over $200,000 (single) or $250,000 (married filing
    jointly)
- Ordinary federal income tax, Social Security, and Medicare taxes are withheld from your
  paycheck by your employer and are called
  [**employment taxes**](https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Understanding-Employment-Taxes).
- üîπ Long-term capital gains are
  [taxed at a lower rate](https://www.fool.com/taxes/2017/12/11/long-term-capital-gains-tax-rates-in-2018.aspx)
  than ordinary income tax: **0%**, **15%**, or **20%**. This covers cases where you get
  dividends or sell stock after holding it a year.
  If you are in the middle brackets (more than about $37K and less than $413K of ordinary
  income), your long-term capital gains rate is 15% ([more details](http://taxes.about.com/od/Federal-Income-Taxes/fl/Federal-Income-Tax-Rates-for-the-Year-2015.htm)).
- [AMT](http://fairmark.com/general-taxation/alternative-minimum-tax/alternative-minimum-tax-101/)
  is a [complex part](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc556.html) of the federal tax code many
  taxpayers never worry about.
  Generally, you do not pay AMT unless it is ‚Äútriggered‚Äù by specific situations, typically
  [high income (>$250K) or high deductions](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/congratulations-you-owe-the-alternative-minimum-tax-2014-01-14).
  It also depends on where you file, since your state taxes can significantly affect your
  deductions. Confusingly, if you are affected, AMT tax rates are usually at **26%** or **28%**
  marginal tax rate, but effectively **35%** for some ranges, meaning it is
  [higher than ordinary income tax for some incomes and lower for others](http://www.forbes.com/sites/feeonlyplanner/2011/12/16/the-alternative-minimum-tax-sweet-spot/).
  AMT rules are so complicated you often need professional tax help if they might apply to
  you. The IRS‚Äôs
  [AMT Assistant](https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Alternative-Minimum-Tax-(AMT)-Assistant-for-Individuals)
  might also help.
- ‚ùó AMT is relevant to you if you‚Äôre reading this.
  It is important to understand because exercising ISOs can trigger AMT. In some cases a
  *lot* of AMT, *even when you haven‚Äôt sold the stock* and have no money to pay.
  We discuss this [later](#taxes-on-stock-and-options).
- üîπ Section 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code provides a special tax break for qualified
  small business stock held for more than five years.
  Currently, this tax break is a 100% exclusion from income for up to $10M in gain.
  There are also special rules that enable you to rollover gain on qualified small business
  stock you have held for less than five years.
  Stock received on the exercise of options can qualify for the Section 1202 stock benefit.

### State taxes

State tax rates and rules
[vary significantly state to state](http://taxfoundation.org/article/state-individual-income-tax-rates-and-brackets-2015).
Since federal rates are much higher than state rates, you usually think of federal tax
planning first.
But you also should know a bit about tax rates in your state.

State long-term capital gains rates
[vary widely](http://www.fool.com/personal-finance/taxes/2014/10/04/the-states-with-the-highest-capital-gains-tax-rate.aspx).
**California** has the highest, at **13.3%**, while other states have none.

üîπ For this reason, some people even consider moving to another state if they are likely
to have a windfall gain, like selling a lot of stock after an IPO.

üöß How you determine to what state you owe taxes?
Any good resources on this?

## Taxes on Equity Compensation

Now we‚Äôve covered the basic concepts of equity and taxes, here are some messy details of
how they interact.

As already discussed, employees can get restricted stock, stock options, or RSUs.
The tax consequences for each of these is dramatically different.

### 83(b) elections

Okay, we are now ready to describe one of the most important and complex decisions you may
need to make regarding stock awards and stock options.

As a few cursory Google searches for ‚Äú83(b) election‚Äù will indicate, many a blog post has
been dedicated to this subject.
But if you‚Äôve made it this far, some of this should be easier to follow.

- Generally, restricted stock is taxed as [ordinary income](#kinds-of-income)
  [*when it vests*](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/tax/09/restricted-stock-tax.asp?performancelayout=true).
- If the stock is in a startup with low value, this may not result in a high tax.
  If it‚Äôs been years since the stock was first granted and the company is now worth a lot,
  the taxes owed could be quite significant.
- üÑ≥üîπ The Internal Revenue Code offers an alternative that will protect you from this high
  potential tax, called a
  [**Section 83(b) election**](http://acceleratedvesting.com/what-is-an-83b-election-and-when-do-i-make-it-part-1-with-graphic/),
  which ensures that you‚Äôll be taxed on the receipt of the ‚Äúproperty‚Äù (the stock), rather
  than at the time the stock vests.
  Basically, with a Section 83(b) election, you‚Äôre telling the IRS you want to pay taxes
  early, and this can potentially reduce your tax significantly:
  If the shares go up in value, the taxes owed on vesting might be far greater than the
  taxes owed at the time of receipt.
  - ‚òùÔ∏è Why is it called an *election*? Because you are *electing* (a fancy word for
    ‚Äúchoosing‚Äù) to pay taxes early in exchange for this treatment by the IRS. Does the IRS
    secretly enjoy making simple concepts sound confusing?
    We‚Äôre not sure.
- An 83(b) election isn‚Äôt guaranteed to reduce your taxes, however.
  For example, the value of the stock may not increase.
  And if you leave the company before you vest, you *don‚Äôt* get the taxes you‚Äôve paid back.
- ‚ùó You must file the 83(b) election yourself with the IRS
  [**within 30 days**](https://www.irs.gov/irb/2012-28_IRB/ar12.html) of the grant or exercise, or
  the opportunity is irrevocably lost.
- ‚òùÔ∏è Note an 83(b) election is made on receipt of actual shares of stock.
  Technically, it cannot be made on the receipt of a stock *option* itself:
  You first must exercise that option, then file the election.
- If you receive an early exercisable stock option (when you don‚Äôt have to wait for the the
  stock to vest), you can make an 83(b) election on receipt of the shares on exercise.
- Section 83(b) elections do not apply to vested shares;
  the election only applies to stock that is not yet vested.
  Thus, if you receive options that are *not* early exercisable (meaning you have to wait
  until they vest to exercise), an 83(b) election would not apply.
- üîπ Founders and very early employees will almost always want to do an 83(b) election upon
  the receipt of unvested shares, since the stock value is probably low.
  If the value is really low, and the taxes owed are not that great, you can make the
  election without having to pay much tax and start your capital gains holding period on the
  shares.
- üöß Clarify here which types of equity compensation the 83b can apply to.

### 409A valuations

üÑ≥ When stock vests, or you exercise an option, the IRS will consider what the **fair
market value (FMV)** of the stock is when determining the tax you owe.
Of course, if no one is buying and selling stock, as is the case in most startups, then
its value isn‚Äôt obvious.
For the IRS to evaluate how much stock is worth, it uses what is known as the
[**409A valuation**](http://www.fenwick.com/FenwickDocuments/409_Valuations_Stock_Options.pdf) of
the company.

- üöß More on the history and motivation of 409As.
- üöß Lay out up front the relationship between the FMW and the tax you owe, and the 409A and
  the FMW.

- The startup pays for an appraisal that sets the 409A, typically annually or after events
  like fundraising.
- üîπ A company wants the 409A to be low, so that employees make more off options, but not
  low enough the IRS won‚Äôt consider it reasonable.
  Typically, the 409A is much less than what investors pay for preferred stock;
  often, it might be only a third of the preferred stock price.
- üå™ Although the 409A process is required and completely standard for startups, the
  practice is a strange mix of formality and complete guesswork.
  It has been called ‚Äúquite precise‚Äîremarkably inaccurate," by legendary venture capitalist
  Bill Gurley. You can
  [read more about its nuances and controversies](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/business/dealbook/valuation-shell-game-silicon-valleys-dirty-secret.html).
- üöß More on when 409As happen.
  A 409A does have to happen every 12 months to grant the company safe harbor.
  A 409A has to be done after any event that could be deemed a ‚Äúmaterial event,‚Äù which is a
  fancy way of saying any event that could change the price or value of the company
  meaningfully. Other examples could be if a CEO leaves, if the company starts making a ton
  of money, or an acquisition.

### Taxes on ISOs and NSOs

Typically, early to mid-stage companies grant stock options, and they may be
[ISOs or NSOs](#kinds-of-stock-options).

- Companies generally decide to give ISOs or NSOs depending on the legal advice they get.
  It‚Äôs rarely up to you which you get, so you need to know about both.
  There are pros and cons of each from both the recipient‚Äôs and the company‚Äôs perspective.
  - üî∏ ISOs cannot be granted to non-employees (like independent contractors).
    - üöß Move this detail to defining occurrence of ISO.
- ‚ùóüîπ **When you owe tax**: When you get stock options and are considering if and when to
  exercise them, you need to think about the taxes.
  In principle, you need to think about taxes
  - (1) at **time of grant**
  - (2) at **time of exercise**
  - (3) at **time of sale**
- These events trigger ordinary tax (high), long-term capital gains (low), or AMT (possibly
  high) taxes in different ways for NSOs and ISOs.
  - üÑ≥ The taxes at time of exercise will depend on the gain between the strike price and the
    FMV, known as the **spread** or the
    [**bargain element**](http://www.investorwords.com/5414/bargain_element.html).
- üîπ If you are granted ISOs or NSOs at a low strike price, and the bargain element is zero,
  then you may be able to exercise at a reasonable price without triggering taxes at all.
  So assuming the company allows it, it makes sense to early exercise immediately (buying
  most or all of the shares, even though they‚Äôre not vested yet) and simultaneously file an
  83(b) election.
- üî∏‚òùÔ∏è As we laid out in the previous section, [83(b) elections](#83b-elections) are elections
  to be taxed on the receipt of property even though you might have to forfeit or give back
  the property to the company.
  You can make an election on the receipt of stock, but you cannot make the election on the
  receipt of an option or an RSU because options and RSUs are not considered property for
  purposes of Section 83(b).
  - üöß Move or remove this note, as it‚Äôs covered earlier?
- üî∏üå™ ISOs are often preferred by startups, as they‚Äôre supposedly better for employees from
  a tax perspective.
  This assumes that (1) AMT won‚Äôt be triggered and (2) you‚Äôll get low long-term capital
  gains rate by holding the stock for the appropriate holding periods.
  However, often you either run afoul of the AMT trap, or don‚Äôt hold the stock long enough
  with the complicated 1 year + 2 year requirement, or the spread at exercise is small or
  zero, so the difference wouldn‚Äôt matter anyway.
  NSOs do have a slightly higher tax because of the need to pay employment taxes on NSOs and
  not ISOs. Overall, it‚Äôs not clear the ISO is that much better for employees, so
  [many](http://www.startuplawblog.com/2010/08/11/top-reasons-nqos-over-isos/)
  [people](http://www.business2community.com/finance/nsos-better-isos-0826167#fz1HTCiOQxRyTr62.97)
  argue for NSOs instead.
- üî∏‚òùÔ∏è This is partly because ISOs
  [can make it harder](http://thestartuplawblog.com/the-problem-with-immediately-exercisable-isos/)
  to meet the long-term capital gains holding period.
  Many people expect early exercise together with an 83(b) election will help them hold the
  stock longer, to qualify for long-term capital gains.
  While this is true for NSOs, there is a murky part of the rules on ISOs that implies that
  even with an 83(b) election, the capital gains holding period does not begin until the
  shares actually vest.
  So, if you want to immediately exercise an option and file a Section 83(b) election, and
  you might have liquidity soon, it‚Äôs better if you can have it be an NSO.

### The AMT trap

One scenario is so dangerous we give it its own section.

‚ùó If you have received an ISO, exercising it may unexpectedly trigger a big AMT bill‚Äîeven
before you actually make any money on a sale!
If there is a large spread between strike price and 409A value, you are potentially on the
hook for an enormous tax bill, even if you can‚Äôt sell the stock.
This has pushed people into bankruptcy.
It also caused Congress to grant a one-time forgiveness;
the odds of that happening again are very low.

This is sometimes called the **AMT trap**. To make matters worse, you probably can‚Äôt sell
the stock to pay the tax bill.
This
[infamous](https://medium.com/@barryjk/the-tax-law-that-is-unintentionally-hammering-silicon-valley-employees-894a7b54ba8a)
[problem](https://www.nceo.org/articles/stock-options-alternative-minimum-tax-amt) has
trapped many employees and
[bankrupted people](http://blog.sfgate.com/dgreenberg/2012/06/22/tax-advice-from-the-dot-com-bubble-beware-of-isos/)
during past dot-com busts.
Now more people know about it, but it‚Äôs still a significant obstacle to plan around.
(Note that if your AMT is for events prior to 2008,
[you‚Äôre off the hook](http://www.startuplawblog.com/2009/04/03/whoops-i-didnt-pay-amt-on-my-isos-exercised-prior-to-1108-what-do-i-do/).)

Understand this topic and talk to a professional if you exercise ISOs.

The AMT trap does not apply to NSOs.

### Stock awards vs ISOs vs NSOs

Because the differences are so nuanced, here is a summary of the differences between
restricted stock awards, ISOs and NSOs from an employee‚Äôs point of view.
(If you relish tax complexity, you can peruse more
[here](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc427.html),
[here](http://www.startuplawblog.com/2013/05/15/incentive-stock-options-vs-nonqualified-stock-options/),
[here](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/07/esoabout.asp), and
[here](http://www.startuplawblog.com/2010/08/11/top-reasons-nqos-over-isos/)):

- **Restricted stock awards**: Assuming vesting, you pay full taxes early with the 83(b) or at
  vesting:

  - At grant:
    - If 83(b) election filed, ordinary tax on FMV
    - None otherwise
  - At vesting:
    - None if 83(b) election filed
    - Ordinary tax on FMV of vested portion otherwise
  - At sale:
    - Long-term capital gains tax on gain if held for *1 year past exercise*
    - Ordinary tax otherwise (including immediate sale)

- **NSOs**: You pay full taxes at exercise, and the sale is like any investment gain:

  - At grant and vesting:
    - No tax if granted at FMV
  - At exercise:
    - Ordinary tax on the bargain element
    - Income and employment tax withholding on paycheck
  - At sale:
    - Long-term capital gains tax on gain if held for *1 year past exercise*
    - Ordinary tax otherwise (including immediate sale)

- **ISOs**: You might pay less tax at exercise, but it‚Äôs complicated:

  - At grant and vesting:
    - No tax if granted at FMV
  - At exercise:
    - AMT tax event on the bargain element;
      no ordinary or capital gains tax
    - No income or employment tax withholding on paycheck
  - At sale:
    - Long-term capital gains if held for *1 year past exercise and 2 years past grant date*
    - Ordinary tax otherwise (including immediate sale)

- üöß Visualize this as a table.

### Taxes on RSUs

- If you are awarded RSUs, each unit represents one share of stock that you will be given
  when the units vest.
- Here‚Äôs the tax summary for RSUs, followed by some details:
  - At grant:
    - No tax
  - At vesting/delivery:
    - Ordinary tax on current share value
  - At sale:
    - Long-term capital gains tax on gain if held for *1 year past exercise* - Ordinary tax
      otherwise (including immediate sale)
- üî∏ When you receive your shares, you are taxed on their value
  [at that time](http://joewallin.com/2014/09/13/rsus-vs-restricted-stock-vs-stock-options/). If
  you are an employee, this means you may have to write a check to the company to cover your
  income and employment tax withholding.
  Often, for U.S. employees, companies
  [will withhold the tax in the form of shares](https://www.schwab.com/public/eac/resources/articles/rsu_basics.html)
  such that no action is required by the employee at vesting time.
- If you receive an RSU when the stock is of little value, you cannot elect to be taxed on
  the value of that stock when you receive the RSU‚Äîyou pay taxes at vesting time, based on
  the value of the shares at that time.
- üî∏ RSUs present some big problems in private companies:
  - You will owe tax when you receive the shares, even though they are illiquid.
  - You can‚Äôt minimize the tax impact of an increase in value of the underlying shares between
    the date you receive the RSU and the date it is settled.
  - If you are an employee you will have to write a check to the company to satisfy your
    income and employment tax withholding.
- üî∏ RSUs are less attractive than stock options from a tax point of view because you cannot
  make an 83(b) election with respect to an RSU. By contrast, if you receive a stock option,
  as long as it‚Äôs priced at fair market value, you will have no income upon receipt of the
  options, and your income tax and employment tax consequences will be deferred until you
  exercise, an event under your control for the most part.

üöß Visualize this in the same system as the previous section.

### Tax dangers

Because they are so important, we list some costly errors to watch out for when it comes
to taxes on equity compensation:

- ‚ùó If you are going to file an 83(b) election, it must be **within 30 days** of stock grant
  or option exercise.
  Often, law firms will take a while to send you papers, so you might only have a week or
  two. If you miss this window, it could potentially have giant tax consequences, and is
  essentially an irrevocable mistake‚Äîit‚Äôs one deadline the IRS won‚Äôt extend.
  When you file, get documentation from the post office as well as a delivery confirmation,
  and include a self-addressed, stamped envelope for the IRS to send you a return receipt.
  (Some people are so concerned about this they even ask a friend to go with them to the
  post office as a witness!)
- ‚ùó Watch out for [the AMT trap](#the-amt-trap) we‚Äôve already discussed.
- ‚ùó If you exercise your options, and your income had been from consulting rather than
  employment (1099, not W-2), you will be subject to the self-employment tax in addition to
  income tax. Self-employment taxes consist of both the employer and the employee side of
  FICA. This means you will owe the Social Security tax component (6.2%) up to the FICA wage
  base, and you will owe the Hospital Insurance component (2.9%) on all of your income.
- ‚ùó Thoughtfully decide when to exercise options.
  As discussed, if you wait until the company is doing really well, or when you are leaving,
  the delay can have serious downsides.

## Evaluating Equity Compensation

If you‚Äôre familiar with the types of equity and how it relates to taxes we‚Äôve covered in
previous sections, you now have many of the tools you need to evaluate an offer that
includes equity compensation, or to evaluate equity you currently have in a company.

- In determining the value of equity, you have to figure out (or, more accurately, make
  educated guesses about) several things.
  We can start measuring the potential value of equity by doing our best to determine the
  following:
  - *Stock value*: Determined by the value the company will have in the future, and the number
    of shares you own.
  - *Vesting and liquidity*: When you will actually receive the shares and when you‚Äôll be able
    to sell them.
  - *Tax*: Both the purchase and the sale of stock can require that you pay taxes‚Äîsometimes
    very large amounts.
    There are several kinds of taxes that apply when you have stock:
    income, capital gains, and AMT.
- üîπ *Percentage*: Knowing how many shares of stock or stock options you have is meaningless
  unless you know the number of outstanding shares.
  What matters is the **percentage ownership** of the company the shares represent.
  Typically, this number is presented in percent or **basis points** (hundredths of a
  percent). Some companies don‚Äôt volunteer this information unless you specifically ask, but
  it‚Äôs always a fair question, since without it, the offer of shares is almost meaningless.
- üîπ It is critical to understand [dilution](#fundraising-growth-and-dilution) and
  [risk](#stages-of-a-startup) to know the possible future value of equity for the company and
  its stage. [This article](http://codingvc.com/valuing-employee-options/) from Leo Polovets
  provides a thoughtful overview.

### Dangers evaluating equity compensation

Some of these items have already been discussed, but

- ‚ùó **Details matter**: When it comes to equity compensation, details matter!
  You need to understand the type of stock grant or stock option in detail, and what it
  means for your taxes, to know the likely value.
- ‚ùó **Seek professional advice and understand it**: Because details are so important,
  [professional advice](#seeking-professional-advice) from a tax advisor and a lawyer familiar
  with equity compensation is often a good idea.
  Avoid doing everything yourself, but also avoid blindly trusting advisors without having
  them explain the details to you in a way you understand.
- ‚ùó In some cases, high taxes may prevent you from exercising your options, and if you can‚Äôt
  sell the stock, you could effectively be forced to walk away from it if you can‚Äôt afford
  to exercise.
- ‚ùó Once you get an offer, you need to understand the value of the equity component.
  You need quite a bit of information to figure this out, and should just ask.
  If the company trusts you enough to be making an offer, and still doesn‚Äôt want to answer
  these questions about that offer, it‚Äôs **a warning sign**. (There are many
  [resources](https://blog.wealthfront.com/stock-options-14-crucial-questions/) out there with
  more details about
  [questions](http://www.inc.com/atish-davda/5-questions-you-should-ask-before-taking-a-start-up-job-offer.html)
  like this.)

### Questions to ask about offers

üîπ It‚Äôs helpful to ask questions after you get an offer.
Here are a few especially important ones especially relevant to startups and other private
companies:

- *What percentage of the company do the shares represent?*
- *What set of shares was used to compute that percentage (is this really the percentage of
  all shares, or some subset)?*
- *What did the last round value the company at?
  (I.e. the preferred share price times the total outstanding shares)?*
- *What is the most recent 409A valuation?
  When was it done, and will it be done again soon?*
- *Do you allow early exercise of my options?*
- *Are all employees on the same vesting schedule?*
- *Is there any acceleration of my vesting if the company is acquired?*
- *Do you have a policy regarding follow-on stock grants?*
- *Does the company have any repurchase right to vested shares?*
- *What exit valuation will need to be achieved before common stock is has positive value
  (that is, what are the liquidation overhangs)?*
- *Does the company extend the exercise window of the options of employees that depart?
  (Especially for ISOs)*

After you have the information, you‚Äôll be able to consider the
[possible scenarios](#common-scenarios) of when you might want to exercise options.

üîπ If you‚Äôre considering working for a startup‚Äîthat is, the company is so young the
business has a lot of risk still‚Äîthere are further questions to ask in order to assess the
state of the company‚Äôs business.
Before or when you‚Äôre getting an offer is the right time to do this.
Startups are understandably careful about sharing financial information, so you may not
get full answers to all of these, but you should at least ask:

- *How much money has the company raised (including in how many rounds, and when)?*
- *What did the last round value the company at?*
- *Will the company likely raise more capital soon?*
- *How long will the company‚Äôs current funding last?*
  (This will likely be given at the current burn rate, or how quickly a company is spending
  its funding, so will likely not include calculations for things like future employee
  salaries.)
- *What is the hiring plan?*
  (How many people over what time frame?)
- *What is the revenue now, if any?
  What are the revenue goals/projections?*
- *Where do you see this company in 1 year and 5 years, in terms of revenue, number of
  employees, and market position?*

### Some stock option scenarios

Stock options are an exercise in deciding when to exercise and when to sell, if you can.
Here we lay out some common scenarios that might apply to you.
Considering these scenarios and their outcomes can help you evaluate your position and
what you should do.

- **Exercise and hold**: You can write the company a check and pay any taxes on the spread.
  You are then a stockholder, with a stock certificate that may have value in the future.
  As discussed [above](#equity-compensation-details), you may do this:
  - Early, even immediately upon grant.
  - Before vesting (if early exercise is available to you).
  - Sometime after vesting.
  - After leaving the company, as long as the exercise window is open.
    - üî∏ Recall that often the [window closes](#how-options-expire) soon after you leave a company,
      often 90 days after termination.
- **Wait until acquisition**: If the company is acquired for a large multiple of the exercise
  price, you may then use your options to buy valuable stock.
  However, as discussed, your shares could be worth next to nothing unless the sale price
  exceeds the liquidation overhang, since preferred stock is paid out first.
- üî∏ **Secondary market**: As [discussed](#what-is-your-stock-worth), in some cases it‚Äôs possible
  to exercise and sell the stock in a private company directly to a private party.
  But this generally requires some cooperation from the company and is not something you can
  always count on.
- **Cashless exercise**: In the event of an IPO, a broker can allow you to exercise all of your
  vested options and immediately sell a portion of them into the public market, removing the
  need for cash up front to exercise and pay taxes.
- üîπ Note that some of these scenarios may require significant cash up front, so it makes
  sense to do the math early.
- If you are in a tight spot, where you may lose valuable options altogether because you
  don‚Äôt have the cash to exercise, it‚Äôs worth exploring each of the scenarios above, or
  combinations of them, such as exercising and then selling a portion to pay taxes.
  In addition, there are a few funds or individual investors who may be able to front you
  the cash to exercise or pay taxes in return for an agreement to share profits.

## Offers and Negotiations

### Why negotiation matters

Before accepting an offer, you‚Äôll want to
[negotiate firmly and fairly](http://cefne.com/en/harvard-method-negotiation). You‚Äôre planning
to devote a lot of your time and sanity to any full-time role;
help yourself make sure that this is
[what you want](https://hbr.org/2016/12/think-strategically-about-your-career-development).

‚òùÔ∏è It‚Äôs perfectly natural to be anxious
[anxious](https://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/negotiation-skills-daily/the-impact-of-anxiety-and-emotions-on-negotiations-how-to-avoid-misjudgment-in-negotiation-scenarios/)
about negotiations, whether you‚Äôre going through this process for the first or the tenth
time. There is a lot at stake, and it can be uncomfortable and stressful to ask for things
that you need or want.
[Many people think](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tanyatarr/2017/12/31/here-are-five-negotiation-myths-we-can-leave-behind-in-2017/#250ff99b15f9engaging)
negotiation could get the job offer revoked, so they‚Äôll accept their offer with little or
no discussion.
But remember that negotiations are the first experience you‚Äôll have of working with your
new team. If you‚Äôre nervous, it can help to remember why it‚Äôs important to have these
conversations:

- Negotiations ask you to focus on what you actually want.
  What is important to you‚Äîpersonal growth, career growth, impact, recognition, cash,
  ownership, teamwork?
  Not being clear with yourself on what things you prioritize is a recipe for
  dissatisfaction later.
- If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the terms of your offer, accepting it without discussion can
  be tough not just for you but for your new company and colleagues as well.
  No one wants to take on a hire who‚Äôs going to walk away in just a few months when
  something better comes along.
  For everyone‚Äôs sake, take your time now to consider what you really want‚Äîand then
  [ask for it](https://www.earnest.com/decision-making/articles/negotiating-job-offers-science-asking-want).
- The negotiation process itself can teach you a lot about a company and your future
  manager. Talking about a tough subject like an offer is a great way to see how you‚Äôll work
  with someone down the road.

A Guide like this can‚Äôt give you personalized advice on what a reasonable offer is, as
that depends greatly on your skills, the marketplace of candidates, what other offers you
have, what the company can pay, what other candidates the company has found, and the
company‚Äôs needs.
However, this section covers some basics of what to expect with offers, and tips on
[negotiating an offer](https://hbr.org/2014/04/15-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer).

### Equal treatment

üîπ Companies can and should work hard to ensure that all candidates are
[given equal treatment](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/pay-equity/steps/introduction/)
in the hiring process but
[inequalities persist](https://iwpr.org/publications/gender-wage-gap-2017-race-ethnicity/).
[Workplace disparities](https://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2208&context=articles)
in pay and opportunity span race and gender, with research focusing on
[inequality in the U.S. workplace](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/01/racial-gender-wage-gaps-persist-in-u-s-despite-some-progress/),
[executive leadership](https://pr-paywatch-aflcio.pantheonsite.io/paywatch/company-pay-ratios)
and its well documented
[lack of diversity](http://fortune.com/2017/06/09/white-men-senior-executives-fortune-500-companies-diversity-data/),
and the [technology industry](https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/reports/hightech/).
[Gender bias](https://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/lean-out-the-dangers-for-women-who-negotiate)
in negotiation is also an issue, making many women feel uncomfortable negotiating.

More effort is needed to end biases and close the wage gap but candidates should know
their worth and understand that they can negotiate to get better offers.

### General expectations

- Many companies will give some flexibility during [negotiations](#negotiation-tips), letting
  you indicate whether you prefer
  [higher salary](https://hired.com/blog/candidates/salary-vs-equity-how-decide-whats-right/) or
  [higher equity](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/041515/equity-vs-salary-what-you-need-know.asp).
- Candidates with
  [competing offers](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/employee-relations/pages/using-a-job-offer-as-leverage-is-no-longer-a-big-no-no.aspx)
  almost always have more leverage and get better offers.
- Salaries at startups are often a bit below what you‚Äôd get at an established company, since
  early on, cash is at a premium.
  For very early stage startups, risk is higher, offers can be more highly variable, and
  variation among companies will be greater, particularly when it comes to equity.
- The dominant factors determining equity are what funding [stage](#stages-of-a-startup) a
  company is at, and the role you‚Äôll play at the company.
  If no funding has been raised, large equity may be needed to get early team members to
  work for very little or for free.
  Once significant funding of an A round is in place, most people will take typical or
  moderately discounted salaries.
  Startups with seed funding lie somewhere in between.

### Offers

üÑ≥ Companies will often give you a **verbal offer** for the job, to speed things along and
facilitate the negotiation, then follow it with a **written offer** if it seems like you‚Äôre
close to a point where you‚Äôll agree.
The written offer takes the form of an
[**offer letter**](https://www.upcounsel.com/employee-offer-letter), which is just the summary
sent to you, typically with an expiration date and other details and
[paperwork](#documents-and-agreements). If you are ready to accept the terms of the offer
letter, you can sign the offer letter.

Although companies often want you to sign right away, to save time and effort, if you‚Äôre
doing it thoughtfully, you‚Äôll also be talking to the company (typically with a hiring
manager, your future manager, or a recruiter, or some combination) multiple times before
signing. This helps you negotiate details and offers you a chance to get to know the
people, the company, and the role, so that you can make the best decision for you.

Things to look for in
[the offer letter](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/how-to-read-offer-letter/) include:

- Title and level:
  What your role is officially called, who you report to, and what level of seniority your
  role is within the company.
- Salary: What you‚Äôre paid in cash, in a year, before taxes.
- Equity compensation:
  You know what this is now.
- Bonus: Additional cash you‚Äôll get on a regular basis, if the company has a plan for this.
- [Signing bonus](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/signing-bonus.asp): Cash you get just for
  signing. Note signing bonuses usually have some strings attached‚Äîfor example you will have
  to pay it back if you leave the company within 12 or 24 months.

While the details may not be included in your offer letter, to get full information on
your [total rewards](https://www.worldatwork.org/total-rewards-model/) you‚Äôll also want to
discuss:

- [Benefits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_benefits): Job perks in addition to
  compensation, including health insurance and retirement savings and snacks.
- All other aspects of the job that might matter to you, like time off, ability to work from
  home, flexible hours, training and education, and so on.

Some general notes on these components (credits to
[Cristina Cordova](https://twitter.com/cjc/status/984094472190349312) for some of these):

- Early stage startups will focus on salary and equity and (if they are funded) benefits.
  An offer of bonuses or a signing bonus are more common in larger, prosperous companies.
- Bonuses are usually standardized to the company and your level, so not likely to be
  something you can negotiate.
- The signing bonus is highly negotiable.
  This doesn‚Äôt mean any company will give large signing bonuses, but it‚Äôs feasible because
  signing bonus amounts vary candidate by candidate, and unlike salary and bonus, it‚Äôs a
  one-time cost to the company.
  Keep in mind that the terms of your contract may dictate that you return a signing bonus
  if you leave the company right away.

### Offers from startups

Because startups are so much smaller than many established companies, and because they may
grow quickly, a few other things are worth remembering when negotiating with startups:

- **Cash versus equity**: If your
  [risk tolerance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risktolerance.asp) is reasonably high,
  it‚Äôs reasonable to ask for an offer with more equity and less cash.
  If a company begins to do well, it‚Äôll likely ‚Äúlevel up" lower salaries (bringing them
  closer to market average) even if you got more equity up front.
  On the other hand, if you ask for more cash and less equity, it‚Äôs unlikely you‚Äôll be able
  to negotiate to get more equity later on, since equity is increasingly scarce over time
  (at least in a successful company!). [Mark Suster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Suster),
  entrepreneur and VC, stresses the need to
  [level up](https://bothsidesofthetable.com/this-is-how-startups-level-up-after-raising-money-328d17076515)
  by scaling pay, spending and focus appropriately at each funding stage.
- üöß What is risk and how should people think about risk tolerance?
  Good readings on this?
- Negotiating title and exact details of your role early on may not matter as much in a
  small and growing company, because your role and the role of others may change a lot
  quickly. It‚Äôs more important that you respect the founders and leaders of the company.
  It‚Äôs more important that you feel
  [you are respected](https://blog.shrm.org/blog/respect-and-trust-top-the-list-of-most-important-employee-job-satisfaction).

### Typical employee equity levels

- üîπüå™ There are no hard and fast rules, but for **post-series A startups** in **Silicon Valley**,
  this table, based on
  [the one by Babak Nivi](http://venturehacks.com/articles/option-pool-shuffle#market), gives
  ballpark equity levels that many think are reasonable.
  These would usually be for restricted stock or stock options with a standard 4-year
  vesting schedule.
  They apply if each of these roles were hired just after an A round and are also being paid
  a salary (so are not founders or employees hired before the A round).
  The upper ranges would be for highly desired candidates with strong track records.
  - CEO: **5‚Äì10%**
  - COO: **2‚Äì5%**
  - VP: **1‚Äì2%**
  - Independent board member: **1%**
  - Director: **0.4‚Äì1.25%**
  - Lead Engineer **0.5‚Äì1%**
  - Senior Engineer: **0.33‚Äì0.66%**
  - Manager or Junior Engineer: **0.2‚Äì0.33%**
- For **post-series B startups**, equity numbers would be much lower.
  How much lower will depend significantly on the size of the team and the company‚Äôs
  valuation.
- Seed-funded startups would offer higher equity‚Äîsometimes much higher if there is little
  funding.
- üîπ One of the best ways to tell what is reasonable for a given company and candidate is to
  look at offers from companies with similar profiles on [AngelList](https://angel.co/).
- Leo Polovets created a
  [survey of AngelList job postings from 2014](http://codingvc.com/analyzing-angellist-job-postings-part-2-salary-and-equity-benchmarks),
  an excellent summary of equity levels for the first few dozen hires at these early-stage
  startups. For **engineers** in Silicon Valley, the highest (not typical!)
  equity levels were:
  - Hire #1: up to **2%‚Äì3%**
  - Hires #2 through #5: up to **1%‚Äì2%**
  - Hires #6 and #7: up to **0.5%‚Äì1%**
  - Hires #8 through #14: up to **0.4%‚Äì0.8%**
  - Hires #15 through #19: up to **0.3%‚Äì0.7%**
  - Hires #21 [sic] through #27: up to **0.25%‚Äì0.6%**
  - Hires #28 through #34: up to **0.25%‚Äì0.5%**
- Keep in mind much of the above information is heavily biased toward early-stage Silicon
  Valley tech startups, not companies as a whole across the country.

### Negotiation tips

üöß Structure: Move negotiation points earlier?

Companies will always ask you what you want for compensation, and you should always be
[cautious about answering](http://review.chicagobooth.edu/strategy/2018/article/how-answer-one-toughest-interview-questions).
If you name the lowest number you‚Äôll accept, you can be pretty sure the company‚Äôs not
going to exceed it, at least not by much.

üî∏ Asking about salary expectations is a normal part of the hiring process at most
companies, but asking about **salary history** has been banned in a growing number of
[states, cities and counties](https://www.hrdive.com/news/salary-history-ban-states-list/516662/).
These laws attempt to
[combat pay disparity](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/business/economy/salary-history-laws.html)
among women and minorities by making it illegal for companies to ask about or consider
candidates‚Äô current or past compensation when making them offers.
Make sure you understand the laws relevant to your situation.

Some points on negotiating compensation:

- [Some argue](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-negotiate-make-first-offer-2014-5) that a
  good tactic in negotiating is to start higher than you will be willing to accept, so that
  the other party can ‚Äúwin‚Äù by negotiating you down a little bit.
  Keep in mind, this is just a suggested tactic, and not a hard and fast rule.
- If you are inexperienced and are unsure what a fair offer should look like, avoid saying
  exactly what you want for compensation very early in discussions.
  Though many hiring managers and recruiters ask about
  [salary expectations](http://fistfuloftalent.com/2018/01/ask-salary-without-asking-salary-expectations.html)
  early in the process to avoid risk at the offer stage, some ask to take advantage of
  candidates who don‚Äôt have a good sense of
  [their own worth](https://nuleadership.com/2018/01/08/know-your-worth-compensation-negotiation/).
  Tell them you want to focus on the opportunity as a whole and your ability to contribute
  before discussing numbers.
  Ask them to give you a fair offer once they understand your worth to the company.
- If you are experienced and know your value, it‚Äôs often in your interest to state what sort
  of compensation and role you are looking for to anchor expectations.
  You might even share your expectations early in the process, so you don‚Äôt waste each
  other‚Äôs time.
- Discuss what your compensation might be like in the future.
  No one can promise you future equity, salary, or bonuses, but it should be possible to
  agree what those could look like *if* you demonstrate outstanding performance and the
  company has money.
- If you‚Äôre moving from an established company to a startup, you may be asked to take a
  [salary cut](https://www.quora.com/Should-you-take-a-salary-cut-if-you-join-a-startup). This
  is reasonable, but it‚Äôs wise to discuss explicitly how much the cut is, and when your
  salary will be renegotiated.
  For example, you might take 25% below your previous salary, but there can be an agreement
  that this will be corrected if your performance is strong and the company gets funding.
- üîπ Always negotiate
  [non-compensation aspects](http://www.kennedyexecutive.com/blog/salary-negotiation-33-things-negotiate-money/)
  before agreeing to an offer.
  If you want a specific role, title, opportunity, visa sponsorship, parental leave, special
  treatment (like working from home), or have timing constraints about when you can join,
  [negotiate these early](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/loans/student-loans/negotiate-nonsalary-benefits-job-perks/),
  not late in the process.
- üîπ If you‚Äôre going to be a very early employee, consider asking for a restricted stock
  grant instead of stock options, and a cash bonus equal to the tax on those options.
  The company will have some extra paperwork (and legal costs), but it means you won‚Äôt have
  to pay to exercise.
  Then, if you file an 83(b) election, you‚Äôre simplifying your situation, eliminating the
  AMT issues of ISOs, and maximizing your chances of qualifying for long-term capital gains
  tax.
- üöß What other *specific* suggestions are helpful?

Some notes on the negotiation process itself:

- üîπ Although offer letters have expirations, it‚Äôs often possible to negotiate more time if
  you need it. How much flexibility depends on the situation.
  Some people will go so far as to say ‚Äúexploding job offers‚Äù
  [are a bad practice](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/adam-grant/its-time-to-eliminate-exp_b_4594222.html)
  or
  [make no sense at all](https://erikbern.com/2016/03/16/exploding-offers-are-bullshit.html). If
  you are likely the best candidate for the position, or the role is a specialized and
  well-paid one where there are usually not enough good candidates to meet the demand,
  you‚Äôll likely have plenty of leverage to
  [ask for more time](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-politely-postpone-accepting-a-job-offer-2015-6#dont-be-afraid-to-negotiate-4),
  such as to complete the interview process with other companies.
  For example, software engineering roles in tech companies are like this currently.
- Getting
  [multiple offers](https://www.themuse.com/advice/a-guide-to-juggling-multiple-job-offers-and-coming-out-on-top)
  is always in your interest.
  If you have competing offers, sharing the competing offers with the company you want to
  work for can be helpful, granted your offers are competitive.
  - However, dragging out negotiations excessively so you can ‚Äúshop around‚Äù an offer to other
    companies is considered bad form by some people;
    it‚Äôs thoughtful to be judicious and timely to the extent that it‚Äôs possible.
- ‚ùó Get all agreements in writing, if they are not in your offer letter.
- **Reneging on offers**: Do not accept an offer verbally or in writing unless you‚Äôre ready to
  stand by your word.
  In practice, people do occasionally accept an offer and then go back on it, or
  [renege](https://purduecco.wordpress.com/2016/03/28/the-risks-of-reneging-on-a-job-offer/).
  This can put the company in a difficult position (they may have declined another key
  candidate based on your acceptance), and may hurt your reputation in unexpected ways
  later.
- Robby Grossman, a VP at Wistia, gives
  [a good overview](http://rob.by/2013/negotiating-your-startup-job-offer/) of equity
  compensation and negotiation suggestions.

### Offer and negotiation dangers

To wind up our discussion of offers and negotiations, here are some key dangers and
mistakes to watch out for:

- ‚ùó Do not accept an offer of stock or shares without also asking for the exact number of
  total shares (or, equivalently, getting the exact percentage of the company those shares
  represent). It‚Äôs quite common for some companies to give offers of stock or options and
  tell you only the number of shares.
  Without the percentage, the number of shares is meaningless.
  Not telling you is a deeply unfair practice.
  A company that refuses to tell you even when you‚Äôre ready to sign an offer is likely
  giving you a very poor deal.
- üî∏ If you‚Äôre looking at an offer, work out whether you can and should early exercise, and
  what the cost to exercise and tax will be, before accepting the offer.
- ‚ùó If you join a company right as it raises a new round, and don‚Äôt have the chance to
  exercise right away, they may potentially issue you the options with the low strike price,
  but the 409A valuation of the stock will have gone up.
  This means you won‚Äôt be able to early exercise without a large tax bill.
  In fact, it might not be financially feasible for you to exercise at all.
- üî∏ Vesting starts on a vesting commencement date.
  Sometimes stock option paperwork won‚Äôt reach you for months after you join a company,
  since it needs to be written by the lawyers and approved by the board of directors.
  This usually isn‚Äôt a big problem, but do discuss it in your negotiations to make sure the
  vesting commencement date will reflect the true start date of when you joined the company,
  not the time at which the stock option is granted.
- üî∏ If you‚Äôre going to early exercise, consider it like any investment.
  Don‚Äôt believe every projection about the value of the company you hear.
  Founders will tell you the best-case scenario.
  Remember, most startups fail.
  Do your research and ask others‚Äô opinions about likely outcomes for the company.
- ‚ùó It may not be common, but some companies retain a right to repurchase (buy back) vested
  shares. It‚Äôs simple enough to ask, ‚ÄúDoes the company have any repurchase right to *vested*
  shares?‚Äù (Note repurchasing *unvested* shares that were purchased via early exercise is
  different, and helps you.)
  If you don‚Äôt want to ask, the fair market value repurchase right should be included in the
  documents you are being asked to sign or acknowledge that you have read and understood.
  (Skype had a
  [complex](https://www.quora.com/Which-valley-startups-have-a-Skype-like-repurchase-right)
  [controversy](http://www.wac6.com/wac6/2011/07/skypes-employee-stock-option-plan-worthless-only-if-you-quit-before-2014.html)
  related to repurchasing.)
  You might find a repurchase right for vested shares in the Stock Plan itself, the Stock
  Option Agreement, the Exercise Agreement, the bylaws, the certificate of incorporation, or
  any other stockholder agreement.

## Documents and Agreements

This section covers a few kinds of documents you‚Äôre likely to see as you negotiate your
offer and sign on to a company.
It‚Äôs not exhaustive, as titles and details vary.

- When you are considering your offer from the company, make sure you have all of the
  documents you need:
  - üì• Your [offer letter](https://www.upcounsel.com/employee-offer-letter), which will detail
    salary, benefits, and equity compensation.
  - üì• An
    [Employee Innovations Agreement](https://recruit.smashfly.com/SmashFlyMedia/Docs/12250/12250_168_United%20States%20-%20EIPIA%20English%20%28Rev%2014%20FEBRUARY%202017%29%202%20pages.pdf),
    Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement, or similar, concerning
    intellectual property.
- If you have equity compensation, at some point‚Äîpossibly weeks or months after you‚Äôve
  joined‚Äîyou should get a Summary of Stock Grant, Notice of Stock Option Grant, or similar
  document, detailing your grant of stock or options, along with all details such as number
  of shares, type of options, grant date, vesting commencement date, and vesting schedule.
  It will come with several other documents, which may be exhibits to that agreement:
  - üì• [Stock Option Agreement](https://www.upcounsel.com/stock-option-agreement)
  - üì• [Stock Plan](https://www.upcounsel.com/equity-incentive-plan) (sometimes called a Stock
    Option Plan, or Stock Award Plan, or Equity Incentive Plan)
  - üì•
    [Code Section 409A Waiver and Release](https://www.lawinsider.com/clause/code-section-409a-waiver-and-release)
    (sometimes part of the Stock Option Agreement)
- If you are exercising your options, you should also see paperwork to assist with that
  purchase:
  - üì• [Exercise Agreement](https://www.upcounsel.com/option-exercise-agreement)
  - üì• Instructions and template for early exercise and
    [83(b) election](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rp-12-29.pdf), if applicable
- End of year tax documents
  - üì• You should receive a form
    [3921 or 3922](https://www.irs.gov/uac/form-3921-exercise-of-an-incentive-stock-option-under-section-422-b)
    from your company if you exercised ISO options during the year.
